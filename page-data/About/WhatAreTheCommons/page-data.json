But this method effectively failed.  The Strength of 'competition' from actors who sought to 'own' people digitally, via their 'digital twin' and related ecosystems, was so strong; and there was a complete lack of viable support for works to produce alternatives.  Further to these issues, when getting stuck into the fields of science of consciousness, the debates that were brought about were almost religious in nature.  Then, there were also technologists (many whom i admire) who were talking about AI being like a human; which, when bonded to the exhibits of how these technologies were being commercialised, led me to fear the implications.
