A means to adjust some of the anti-patterns that have emerged threatening to cause us harm.\n\nFrom a ‘high-tech’ point of view, I reach into fields of ontological design and causality associative theorem to consciousness and physics; as may be expressed via mediums that seek, to solve or improve upon issues in various fields including but not limited to those within the field of cyber security. I frankly, have no idea how it is any sensible person or persons believe; a ‘cyber security’ approach can be materially brought about upon a basis that the foundational causal links associated to human functions, be considered ‘out of band’ — not for all cases, but just the opportunistic ones…\n\nHow can any sort of cyber-physical infrastructure seek to perform a trust-worthy ‘cyber-security’ function; when, the fundamental agents associated to any such form of ‘man-made’ infrastructure; are by design, not intended to be the primary beneficiaries of that infrastructure, or its protections.\n\nAn AI design, that seeks to engender a programmatically dissociative & dynamic cyber-physical, socio-economic influence capability; that can be employed to engender probabilities for deterministic ‘futures’. A design, preparing for advancement in the field of ‘tooling’ that takes advantage of advanced fields of science and tech; to manipulate the quantum state, of our realms.\n\nI wonder; if those charged with the responsibility, those who’ve ‘taken control of the funds’, to deliver; I wonder if it is the case, that they know what it is they’re toying with, whether the implications are well known… I watch films, finding solace in the knowledge that they’re declaratively works of fiction; quite different to the channels through which other mediums play games, influence, seek ‘plausible deniability’ or other anti-patterns, that are increasingly harmful.\n\nTherein; I consider the shifts, from the time of the spear; that some may relate to traditional lore and justice; others, may consider in relation to the ‘Holy Lance’, the battle between ‘good’, and evil.\n\nYet in most parts of the world, whilst some still use knives to cause injury to others, in some areas; mostly, knives are used for the preparation of food and materials; and indeed also in medicine, surgery. Whilst not a ‘spear’, there is still a point. Politics shifted from spears to Pens, some time ago; certainly linked to the growth of an information age linked to the growth of print era tools…\n\nYet this has all changed again; so very quickly, now it is not so much about the ‘pen’, but rather the ‘mouse click’, as represented by a ‘curser’ shown, on a ‘screen’… overtime this too shall change…\n\nBut when thinking about coherence, or causal normative occlusion; a consistency links to ‘ideas’…\n\nThe ‘idea’ to find and forge means that supports how it is, people unite, work cooperatively; achieve set goals, and overall, most importantly — strive, to thrive and promote betterment in our real-world.\n\nWhich all seems fairly decoupled to the pre-text deliberations about how it is we’ve been making such enormous investments into advanced apparatus, tools, electronics — that is used to distance us, from each-other; save circumstances where some person, deemed ‘clever’, figures out how to put a ‘toll’ on the engagement medium; like a troll, on a bridge requiring taxes — because they’re a troll…\n\nIts strange, how fables have a means to carry old stories that link to various forms of moral grammar that can be understood by many building forms of psychological bridges linking people, who may otherwise feature character from many diverse differences, linked to that concept — human agency…\n\nSo, whilst I am in a fortunate enough position where I can engage in ‘deep thinking’; and lament the considerations associated with, the causal structure of how it is so many appear to be influenced today.\n\nThe greater consequence of why its worth thinking about, is to figure out how to broker; some fundamental ‘truths’ that can be better employed, to carve paths that encourage better futures. I am fearful of worsening conditions; both domestically and internationally. I am concerned about how some, in a particular class of society; may seek to engender new and different forms of controlling behaviours, abuse behaviour, to fix problems of their own making. History is littered with examples where a few have made a mess; and have sought to clean-up those problems, by engaging in behaviours that make ‘cheap’; life, others, earth.\n\nSo, part of the solution to learning how to better influence these environments; associates to knowing how to stimulate opportunities that appeal to their AI influenced psychopathy; built upon a desire to promote the deliverance of support, or moreover resourcing; to serve their own desires.\n\nAnother part of that same solution; is to look at how longer-term solutions can be better established in the near-term, to diminish the environment of ‘warfare’ put upon said minds; leading to ill-effects.\n\nPart of the problem about how this could be achieved; is that traditional hierarchical structures are more easily ‘influenced’ by these pre-existing systems and group governance frameworks; than is the case for other solutions, that may have radically improved capabilities to transition societies in radical ways, but will be vastly more disruptive.\n\nIf a society is built upon the principle that its safety is built upon its capacity to have people ‘best equipped’ to engage in acts of violence; then if that changes, if the world around that community, that society changes; that the skill of psychologically having the most desirable traits required to punish others with a spear; then a society operated with tools such as pens, paper and gun-powder; with medicines from advanced cultures, linked to space infrastructure, linked to globally distributed energy consuming capabilities funded by all nations; for the administrative benefit of only one; well, one way or another — change, is undoubtedly disruptive.\n\nThere are questions that some who now lead; may well, not be interested in engaging with — in good faith. They may be interested in trying to figure out how to circumvent risk, but ‘cyber peace fair’ (fair dealings); isn’t really, what it is they specialise in; perhaps, in a life linked to many sacrifices. Yet even with said persons, where a dedication of life has been put towards the ideological pursuit of goals. If a path, to better find those goals is found, is explored, and fundamentally sought; then, depending on what it is that path seeks to discover and bring about; the good ones, will still back it; and more importantly, they will back it up. In this situation, I think, the bigger, greater ‘goal’, is about the advancement of our societies and through peaceful works, with cyber-peace-fair infrastructure; tooling required to radically improve productivity and our shared knowledge of our world; and the many little worlds that are built within it, we have a capacity to transition to a new age.\n\n> A Knowledge Age….?\n\n> An epoch level shift in how it is our societies are made able to function…\n\nA capacity to take into consideration, our capacities, to better built upon our means, to engage on a basis of shared values not to harm people, or to go against the principals we espouse to be of most importance, as is written into our books, our laws, our cyber-space realms of records said to be of meritorious purpose; a future, that has much greater hygiene.\n\nWhen thinking about pathways that could be forged to investigate opportunities linked to how it is means to progress from our status quo; to a future, extensible environment; that improved how, how it is we attend to our needs… Part of this entire ecosystem must be about how we better care for the needs of young-ones. How it is, we’re able to triage inequities, now that ‘boomers’ have got the effects upon the world that are so easily linked to their name-sakes; global problems, have now gone ‘boom’; increasingly, it’s time to send them to homes; whilst we figure out how to take care of them, as disabled persons increasingly dependent upon the capacities of those who have not had similar opportunities to build a life of dignity; who they, as elderly, still seek to serve the old.\n\nIt does not seem reasonably sensible or fair to suggest the means for young women to meet the expectations of our modern times; and their needs as persons, are now so much better than before. It is not fair to suggest it is the problem of young people, that the costs linked to seeking to get the skills, the knowledge required to get into gainful work, with increasingly less protections; are solely the problems of those young people; that the means for young people, to have secure shelter, build families as young people — that this is all part of what it is the ‘boomers’ have delivered ‘for them’…\n\nThe boomers, who more often than not — own most of those unaffordable houses; in a society, where global competitors jostle for new forms of rents, to be built and ladened upon the young.\n\nThis is not a moral economy… whilst there is no bombs dropping, if social policy ensured all matters were easily able to be taken to a legal professional and subsequently heard and resolved in courts; then, the old may complain about ‘sustainability’ as the consequence to them may be like, bombs dropping’, not because the problems are not real; rather, because, that’s not how it works for them.\n\nThe complicated underlying issue; that has an array of enormously tied implications to the various deliberations canvassed earlier above; is that we cannot build solutions that afford ‘cyber security’ or sustainability or support our means to ‘care for the old people’, if we do not have a ‘moral economy’. The fundamental series of issues or elements, that is largely well beyond our means of control or influence; indeed, a great deal of the underlying factors link to science or ‘discoveries’ (ie: physics) rather than ‘man made’ things, in isolation to all other form of related consideration…\n\nThe fundamental issue is — this cyber infrastructure — well — in-order for it to work at all, some agents, not all, not necessarily linked to any particular geographic of jurisdictional place; some agents, will increasingly be able to ‘see’ all, that is going on, and by software, make decisions.\n\nA Snippet considering ‘space-time’, in relation to consciousness (and implicitly, AI)\n\nSo, if there’s a plurality of opportunities for different kinds of futures at the moment; maybe, those different opportunities, those different futures; are slowly collapsing, like a form of complex ‘wave function’; most don’t really care for that kind of speak, so we’ll just refer to it as ‘causality’… The ways, means, lenses and what it is we define as ‘solutions’, deployed as infrastructure today, they’re going to have an impact that is likely to have some fairly long-lasting impacts.\n\n> SO, who do they serve? Or what does it serve?\n\nAre we ‘Fighting’, for the young’…?\n\nI think; it is fairly, clearly articulatable to note that there are many ‘opportunities’ to have a deep, hard & meaningful look at how it is we are presently building infrastructure; to support, our growth.\n\nWe have MANY opportunities to look at how to better employ infrastructure to support young people and how that may in-turn transpose to a means that defines better solutions for middle aged persons; and through those sorts of deeper considerations, look to rebuild a new form of moral economy.\n\n> Today, its not at all sensible to suggest ‘housing’, is materially a real-world issue.\n\nCountries such as China have demonstrated that they are able to deploy hospitals for thousands, in weeks. If we wanted to produce low-cost housing, housing that was cheaper to ‘pay off’ than rents; that is something, that could be done.\n\n> The problem is not technology, it’s an issue of rent-seekers.\n\nIf we wanted to bankrupt the money launders, the experts in financial crimes; we could do that so much better, but the consequence is — that we’d need to better support the needs of low-paid, or unpaid workers. We’d need to better address the definition of ‘work’ and what that means today.\n\nWe’d need to figure out how to support capacities that aid in collaboration, cooperation; in the ability for people to, without fear, go about contributing towards the growth of some sort of meaningful derivative outcome; building upon the work produced by others, without having to damage the productivity related factors for all involved, linked to worries about whether good work, useful work, productivity growth of solutions towards some sort of meaningful, useful pursuit; whether, people who do that — will be paid, will be essentially incorporated into the economic framework associated to how it is that work is grown from ideas, to outcomes; by people, working.\n\nWe’d need to accept; and in-turn support, how it is new fangled things like ‘digital identity’ (which is presently made so very badly); supports activities like civic and civics engagement. Whether it be a person who for reasons beyond their means of influence, need to lay their lifes and all of the information about their lives; into the hands of a court, for a judge to save their lives or decide on critical issues relating to their children; or conversely, condemn them; or whether, its about ensuring people have a capacity to engage in law-making, to support how it is our representative democracy is really made to work; regardless of parties that may oppose its most important purpose.\n\nWithout such things, upon what basis do we define ‘cyber security’, or safety?\n\nWe probably also need to have much more refined ways; of looking at entire energy lifecycles, figuring out how to triage complex charlatans seeking newfound ways to seek rents, usury evangelists; screaming ‘climate change’, but without practical means to support our biosphere or human dignity. The differences therein; linked to peace and implicitly therein also; sustainability…\n\nSadly, its too often been the case; that the evil use-cases find their ways to market; long before the others… First, the bomb drops, like the memories of a boomer; and then, they seek to forge peace.\n\nI think; what we most need, is a way to look at the radical expenditure curve; and the various implicit issues that have come about to exist in our present-day reality; and figure out what we want in 50 years. This isn’t so that some sort of nonsense targets is set, to distract; but rather, big concepts.\n\nHow could a place like Australia support a population of around 100m people…? How much desert could be turned into forests; and what sort of things thought of to support a ‘mission to mars’, has more purposeful application when thinking about, how those sorts of ideas could be applied here.\n\n-   How do we produce better, knowledge based, economic models?\n-   What laws are knowingly irrelevant?\n-   How do we determine ‘public trust’,\n\n_or promote the interests of ‘women and girls’, in truly dignified ways; including, for those who have mental health issues and are heterosexual as it does not appear today, that said persons would be supported to form families when young._\n\n_It is important to question how these sorts of human needs, are really, supported._\n\nIn my opinion; there are significant questions about the reasonable viability of many, various expectations, particularly those accumulated upon girls and young women that do not appear to be fair or reasonable, moverover, abusive.\n\nWhen considering the sorts of issues that are linked, inter-generationally therein; how can ‘knowledge economy’ labour, work and education practices; better, support the opportunities societies can uncover if we are able to figure out how to radically improve life-long growth of persons in a manner that is broadly, attentive of the needs of persons; in modern, improved ways.\n\nThe present-day context of how it is Australia; makes its way, is much more closely tied to the benefits brought about by mining natural resources for exportable profits; than we’d prefer to be the case, into the future.\n\nThe ramification of what this means, is that we now need to figure out how to make better use, provide for improved productivity; and support, of our natural resources; including our people, our minds, our knowledge; and our capacity, to build a place where the best from around the world, want to come and make homes; live with peace, prosperity, opportunity, dignity & innately overall, the greatest opportunities for personal growth of moral wealth.\n\nIf we are to create an environment that is equipped to support rapid growth; particularly given the sparce nature of our present-day population given our geographic displacement on our shared earth; then, we’re going to have to figure out radically improved ways, to make much better use of our existing knowledge infrastructure, to support the growth of a diverse & resourceful knowledge asset base; for knowledge economy, and underpinning — socioeconomic growth.\n\nFrom my point of view; I find it hard today, to hear people ‘speak’ about ‘cyber security’, because, they don’t really want to build infrastructure that’s truly secure; they want to be an exception… The problem with these models; by design implication, what they are making; cannot, ever, be secure.\n\nSecurity isn’t found in tools; its found via the connectivity between our minds, our purpose & our works. If we want to build a safer world, a better world, a world where our biosphere flourishes; providing opportunity and advantage for us, as part of our world; to form better choices, build productivity, engineer solutions that makes use of our advanced cyber-legal business systems realms; to improve how it is, we figure out solutions to problems, we haven’t fixed yet today.\n\nThen the ideology of what ‘security’ means; kind of ends-up translating into the observable patterns, shown today. Our ‘status’, in the present, as ‘observers’; is a manifest consequence of our prior works.\n\nWhilst we may be learning how we can better understand that into the future; it seems foolish to be in a position where it seems now necessary to say, we need to review out methods; if we’re going to figure out how to better refine the attenuation, the ‘signal to noise ratio’, the ability to distinguish between ‘facts’, ‘perspectives’ and fictions; our ability to maintain ‘common sense’, and the underlying infrastructure we require to preserve and grow, our liberalised democracy, our values that when tested; seek to be furnished fairness, due-process & probity in our courts of law.\n\nA vision about what our ‘Australian Way’, means, for Young Australians…\n\nThere are many ways our future may evolve; and I’m still thinking about how best to describe the derivative considerations linked to so many complex underlying ideas and constructs, that I’m able to provide something that is easily considered, able to be dutifully delivered; & impactful, by intent.\n\nWe still now have a capacity to figure out how to better build our future, for Australians.\n\nI suggest we look at how we may better support the sorts of ‘brave conversations’, underpinned by support that helps us explore, innovate & test ‘ideas’ and scenarios; of how we work with our world.\n\nHow we shift our Australia, from a place with a noted history of _theft_; to places, made to work with knowledge; as it has always otherwise been, since men, women, boys and girls — started to build a knowledge culture; without books whilst carrying spears, with many tribes and song lines whilst, etching exemplars of our history — into stones.\n\nSometimes, the path forward can be better understood if people take the time to look back, at History. Arguably, the importance of doing so in our present time; is more important, than ever. We are building a technology environment, we ‘say’ its about health, some say identity; but how is it that these tools, these technology environments will help us better understand our history.\n\nThe issues that I am most concerned about; the issues that should really, keep people awake until they sort out; is the issue about how it is, these tools, these technologies, may well obliterate truth.\n\nIf that occurs, if we let that occur, then I am not sure what I can say about hope, for children. I do not know what I can say, that could justify that sort of act, well beyond the realms of toilet-paper shortages; to something that is far more real, that is not directly tied to types of violence that is war. I do not know how it is that our society can best support thrive-ability if it cannot support truth-telling; I do not know how our society can be protected, if we revoke our dutiful support for rules, by laws.\n\n> Laws made by the representatives of the people; representatives, expected to represent the people of their electorates.\n\n> Citizens, within electorates, who are far more than ‘consumers’, within our roles, as we wield the right to maintain our role as future makers…\n\n> not servants, not slaves, not ‘[things](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/thing)’… rather, people, with thoughts & futures…\n\n_If it is too hard to talk about the extraordinarily complex issues that get built into infrastructure apparatus, such as the sorts of things many consider to be part of what some call ‘cyber’, or ICT._\n\nThen, its time to talk about the sort of future we want to engender for the living, for young adults, for children; for those who can actively do something useful in our world where its demanded they be unpaid; and think, about how knowledge, not just ‘information’, systems that fail to distinguish facts and opinions from fictions; let alone the implications brought about, upon young minds — masked at home or otherwise, by loved ones seeking to keep them safe; what is it we need to do, to do better.\n\nHow can we get onto that today.\n\n-   How do we protect progress, from those seeking out the ‘fat fees’ to stand on the top of a burning pile of nonsense, of their making as persons (legal personalities or otherwise); and try, to figure out,\n-   How we may best build safe tooling;\n-   Safe Environments, capabilities for growth of Moral Economy via a Cyber-Physical fabric,\n\nThat if done properly, will provide security, safety and radically shift our productivity potential — as life works ‘better’ with knowledge.","excerpt":"I am a little distracted today, as I consider the implication of various present-day global affairs;
