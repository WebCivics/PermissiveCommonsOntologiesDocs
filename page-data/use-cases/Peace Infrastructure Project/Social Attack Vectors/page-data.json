to [[Biosphere Ontologies]] entities, is fundamentally caused by other [[Biosphere Ontologies]] entities, regardless of the [[SocioSphere Ontologies]] related implications.*  \n\n*There are various forms of Social Attack Vectors, Actions and Activities; that have existed for a very long time, and others that have become a problem in recent decades due to the implications of the use of technology, as does in-turn relate to designs.* \n\nSo far, i have been able to produce some materials that cover the following sub-topics,\n\n- [[Attacks Online]]\n- [[Criminal Activity]]\n- [[Public Sector Wrong Doings]]\n- [[Dishonesty]] and [[Fake News]]\n- [[Dehumanisation]]\n- [[Temporal Attacks]]\n\nThere is an enormous amount of work to be done in relation to this area, and it will take some time.  I also find it to be emotionally exhausting (as noted below); in the meantime, here are some of my thoughts on considerations related to this area of work that is importantly done, to an appropriate level, as to thereafter ensure solutions are illustratively equipped to demonstrate how the ecosystems are intended to work to put a stop to it and/or provide vastly improved means for accessibility to lawful remedy for disaffected persons.  \n\n\n\n#### Introduction: Purpose\n\n\n![[codeofchivalry.jpg]]\n\n\n[[The Values Project]] seeks to employ various methods, including [[What is Web Science]] and other [[Social Factors]] related considerations to structure methodologies to enable means for people to be better equipped to both benefit from the support of [[Safety Protocols]] and related considerations; a difficult, yet important documentation requirment is to make note of various types of 'social attack vectors', whether they're intended to be addressed via [[Trust Factory]] related methodologies or more broadly otherwise (ie; web civics, etc.) its still important that they're able to be considered somehow. \n\n> *Personally, i stuggle doing these sorts of tasks and find it very difficult to have a level of comfort about the idea that i've illustrated the problems well enough, or that it is a safe thing to undertake to do; there is both great sadness and an enormous amount of life invested into seeking to be positively responsive towards addressing problems relating to the human rights of others; and in most cases, it can't really be fully discussed publically. Yet what can be done, is that the underlying principals can be illustrated as a means to support design considerations that denote a level of responsibility that has been so clearly absent from the work done by others.  It is all well and good to solely care about 'yourself' selfishly, and not address the means to address problems - but this is neither appropriate nor responsible, nor consistant with the actual fundamental relationship between leadership and the responsibilities that are inextricably linked to the appropriate use of that term as to strive towards living in a manner that is consistant with, what may be considered a fundamental belief in the existance of universal moral values; as is something that has been referred to for consideration by [Professor Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky)... *\n> \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJ2vr2YnSGA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n>*As i have noted elsewhere, on the 3rd of April 2018 in response to corraspondance with Professor Chomsky, as i worked to pursue the development of the ontology related works required to support [[Freedom of Thought]] and related requirements.  The percieved problem was that whilst many of the [W3C CG](W3.org/community/) related folk (including those more broadly whom are involved in such things as [[What is Web Science]]); there was a percieved problem about the lack of social comprehensions in relation to ontological designs; as can in-turn have the effect of perverting the ability for societies to support 'common sense' and persons to have a meaningul relationship with reality. *\n\n> *Professor Chomsky noted simply;*\n\n\"The fact that there are pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility.  The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself.\"\n\n> *Yet, as has been demonstrated more significantly in recent years; there are complex underlying factors, that i have sought to address which has the effect of feeding into the [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]] designs, alongside the broader ecosystems required to support it; as, the fundamental problem becomes, that where people become disassociated as a consequence of the intended behaviours of others, then the problem becomes linked with the importance of the concept to ensure we're working on [[Ending Digital Slavery]].*\n\n> *[[Understanding Ontologies]] is of critical importance to gain a better comprehension about the implications and in-turn how they have a foundational basis in built upon science; that can and is in-turn exploited by bad actors (often highly sophistocated ones); as is one of the many forms of Social Attack Vectors that are becoming a greater problem due to AI infrastructure, that is not operating appropriate [[Safety Protocols]] - or at least, that's my opinion.  Whilst others may be satisfied and/or happy with the way their ICT systems work for them; the designs brought about via the [[PCT-Webizen Tech Stack]] and related applied methods to address [[Social Factors]] via [[What is Web Science]] and otherwise; in-turn leads to complex factors that fundamentally relate to human consciousness.   An example of the implications has sought to be illustrated by  [Henry Strapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stapp) in the simpliest way i've ever seen done, per below. *\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYPjXz1MVv0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n> *These sorts of considerations in-turn feed into the ecosystems design paradigms that are embedded into the body of works and the method of assembly relating to the ecosystems tooling, etc.*\n\n> *When considering the intended purpose of constituencies such as [[The Webizen Charter]], the [[Community of Practice]] and other [[Webizen Alliance]] [[Commercial Models]] that as stated - seek to support the growth of the far broader [[Peace Infrastructure Project]] , Old concepts, whether they be embedded in the systems of faith that people have in all parts of the world; or via old codes of conduct as noted earlier; and indeed also, old terms such as The term Worshipful;*\n  \n  *(a) Honorable, virtuous, of noble character, estimable; highly respectable, decent; of a knight: excelling in knightly virtues, courageous, courteous, of great prowess; maken ~, to honor (sb.); \n (b) deserving of honor or respect, praiseworthy; also, ?deserving of special treatment, singular [quot. a1500(c1477)]; \n (c) of an act, a ceremony: demonstrative of due honor or respect; \n (d) renowned, eminent, famed; \n (e) bringing honor or distinction; \n (f) as noun: one who is honorable, a respectable person. \n  Source: [Middle English Compendium](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED53455) \n\n> *Which does in-turn relate to the term [The Honourable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable) as is more commonly used today.  The underlying point being that unless there are lawful means to address wrongs that are committed upon people with the express intent of causing that person injury; or indeed also, behaviours that unwittingly or mistakenly caused a person injury; unless there are lawful means to seek remedy, then there is no available means to support Peace.*  \n\n> *As such, i find myself now having to go through the difficult process of describing the nature of some of the horrible things people seemingly seek to gainfully do; involving harms to others. Many of these sorts of issues have existed for a very long time, whilst others have only become a problem or a worse problem due to newer issues.  \n\nIt is thought that the reason why many of these issues haven't been better addressed is in-part due to the sophistocated nature of what needs to occur to bring about a more comprehensive 'ecosystems solution' to address bad behaviour / bad actors.  There are various 'classes' of bad actors which are not the same as one-another.  Often they're interactive and often it is unclear which 'category' or 'agent' is best associated with which category.  \n\nDue to various forms of vulnerability and the lack of functionality provided to support [[Values Credentials]] - that is, the ability to support a means where people self-declare what their values frameworks are; and both, what should be expected of them and in-turn also, the relationship.\n\nSo, this document and the related group of additional documents on related topics; seeks to illustrate various types of 'attack vectors' and in-turn support the means to consider how it is this environment appropriates a mechanism to provide better 'moral security' and/or alerts and accountability measures that are intended to act in-turn to better support healthy (safe) [[Relationships (Social)]], etc.\n\n#### Description of different types of attacks\n\nWhilst work to more appropriately illustrate the somewhat exhaustive nature of how various types of attack vectors are all too often gainfully employed by bad people and those who've been misled by bad people; none of it is simple, and people who have developed to become professionals in the field employ extremely well-developed and complex methodologies to achieve their objectives - which are generally for personally gainful purposes, at the material expense of others, that may well have consequences relating to serious injury, impairment, disability and/or death of their targets.  These sorts of attacks are not simple, and can often evolve in a manner that leads to many different actors getting involved in a broader 'agenda' that serves the interest (at least initially) of the would-be beneficiary.  \n\nThe consequences are often defined by law to constitute an emboidment of actions and/or behaviours that may be thereby considered an alledged crime; and whilst the proper venue to sort these sorts of things out is a court of law, the apparatus to ensure that avenue for lawful remedy be available, is often actively discouraged by an array of parties; not simply those well known to be involved in crime and/or organised crime.  \n\n\n\n\n\n### ChatGPT Contributions\n\nGiven one of the prominently employed social attack vectors is to seek to debase the merit of a persons words and/or ability to be heard or be socially supported to be listened to; the use of ChatGPT has been used fairly extensively; including contributions for this topic also\n\n\nBelow is some content that has been generated by ChatGPT.   \n\nThere are a number of social attack vectors or behaviors that can negatively impact knowledge workers who are working online. Some examples include:\n\n1.  Character assassination: Attacking someone's character online, often through spreading false or malicious information about them, can damage their reputation and credibility, and can make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n2.  Gaslighting: Manipulating someone into doubting their own perceptions or memories, often through the use of manipulation and deception, can undermine their confidence and make it more difficult for them to speak up or advocate for themselves.\n    \n3.  Bullying: Using aggressive or abusive behavior to intimidate or dominate others can create a toxic work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n4.  Exclusion: Excluding someone from important conversations or decisions, or versioning them out of documentation that they were involved in creating, can undermine their contributions and make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Harassment, including sexual harassment, can create a hostile work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n6.  Discrimination: Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic can create an unfair and hostile work environment, and can make it more difficult for people to succeed in their careers.\n\nIt is important to recognise that these social attack vectors can have serious negative impacts on knowledge workers, and can make it more difficult for them to do their jobs effectively. They can also create a toxic work environment that is harmful to the well-being of workers.\n\nTo protect against these types of social attacks, it is important to have clear policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse, and to have processes in place for addressing and resolving conflicts. It is also important to create a culture of respect and inclusion, and to encourage open and honest communication. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive work environment for knowledge workers.\n\nIf a target of social attacks is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to law enforcement, legal and/or court processes, or due to threats or fears for their safety, it is important for their employer or organization to have policies and practices in place to protect them. This may involve providing them with additional support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n\nIt may also be necessary to take steps to protect the privacy of the individual and any other persons who may be involved in the situation. This may involve limiting the dissemination of information about the situation and taking steps to ensure that any information that is shared is done so in a way that is consistent with relevant privacy laws and regulations.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation and protect the safety of the individual and any other persons who may be involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a well-defined process in place for addressing and resolving situations where an individual is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to legal or safety considerations, and to provide the necessary support and resources to ensure that the individual is protected.\n\nIf law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals involved in a situation, it may be necessary to explore other options for addressing the issue. This could involve seeking assistance from other authorities or organizations, such as human rights organizations or NGOs, that may be able to provide additional support and resources.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to pursue legal action to hold law enforcement or other authorities accountable for their failure to protect the safety of the individuals involved. This could involve filing a complaint or lawsuit seeking damages or other remedies.\n\nIt is also important to consider the safety and well-being of the individuals involved and to take steps to protect them, even if law enforcement is not able to provide the necessary protection. This may involve seeking assistance from friends, family, or other trusted sources, or seeking shelter or other forms of support to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a plan in place for addressing situations where law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals, and to have the necessary resources and support available to ensure the safety and well-being of those involved.\n\nIf a person being attacked has reported the matter to law enforcement but the situation has not yet been resolved and they are subsequently attacked online publicly and/or socially, it is important for those managing online community environments to take steps to protect their human rights. This may involve:\n\n1.  Providing support and resources: It is important to provide the person with any necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n    \n2.  Ensuring their safety: It is important to take steps to ensure the safety of the person being attacked, such as by providing them with access to shelter or other forms of support.\n    \n3.  Protecting their privacy: It is important to respect the privacy of the person being attack and to take steps to protect their personal information, especially if they are unable to publish all of the evidence relating to the matter online due to legal or safety considerations.\n    \n4.  Providing a safe and inclusive environment: It is important to create a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the online community, and to have policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse.\n    \n5.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to encourage open and honest communication and to create a culture of respect and inclusion, where people feel safe and supported in sharing their experiences and concerns.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals who are being attack online and to create a more positive and supportive online community environment.\n\nIt is important to note that in order to effectively protect the human rights of individuals who are being attacked online, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities, depending on the nature of the attack and the risks to the individual's safety. It may also be necessary to seek assistance from other organizations or individuals who have expertise in addressing online attacks and can provide additional support and resources.\n\nIt is also important to be aware of relevant laws and regulations that may apply in situations where individuals are being attack online, and to take steps to ensure that the rights of the individuals involved are being protected.\n\nOverall, it is important to take a proactive approach to addressing online attacks and to have the necessary policies and resources in place to protect the human rights of those involved. This may involve providing support and resources to individuals who are being attack, creating a safe and inclusive online community environment, and working with law enforcement and other authorities to address the situation.\n\n### Commercially Motivated Attacks\nIf the underlying purpose of an attack is commercial or related to financial crimes, and the primary purpose is to obtain an advantage and/or harm the victim in a way that will prevent them from being compensated for their work and cause them injury, it is important for communities involved in work-related activities online to take steps to protect human rights and prevent harm to individuals. This may involve:\n\n1.  Having policies in place to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse: It is important to have policies in place that clearly define what types of behavior are not acceptable and provide guidance on how to report and address incidents of financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n2.  Providing support and resources to victims: It is important to provide victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse with the necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n    \n3.  Working with law enforcement and other authorities: It may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.\n    \n4.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to create a culture of transparency and encourage open and honest communication within the community, as this can help to identify and address issues related to financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes.\n\nIn addition to the steps I listed earlier, there are a few other things that communities involved in work-related activities online can do to protect human rights and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes:\n\n1.  Educate members of the community: It is important to educate members of the community about financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to provide them with information about how to recognize and report these types of incidents.\n    \n2.  Promote ethical behavior: It is important to promote ethical behavior and to encourage community members to act with integrity and respect for the rights of others. This may involve establishing codes of conduct or ethical guidelines for community members to follow.\n    \n3.  Foster a culture of inclusivity and respect: It is important to create a culture of inclusivity and respect within the community, and to encourage open and respectful dialogue and debate. This can help to create a more positive and supportive environment and reduce the risk of harm to individuals.\n    \n4.  Monitor and address issues as they arise: It is important to regularly monitor the community for signs of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and to take prompt action to address any issues that are identified.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, communities can create a more positive and supportive environment for all members, and can help to protect the human rights of individuals who may be at risk of abuse.\n\nIf a case or circumstance like this cannot be openly discussed publicly due to privacy, legal, or safety reasons, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to those involved. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individuals involved.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of those involved. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy, legal, and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nIf a person is excluded, socially assaulted, and subjected to other broader social, mental, and economic harms as a result of an attack, and the circumstances of the attack cannot be discussed publicly due to privacy and safety issues, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to the person who has been harmed. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of social, mental, and economic abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of the person who has been harmed. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individual.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nThere are a number of compensation and other measures that could be considered in order to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit people who do the right thing and act in accordance with and support of human rights instruments. Some options may include:\n\n1.  Financial compensation: In cases where individuals have suffered financial harm as a result of being subjected to social attack vectors, it may be appropriate to provide financial compensation to help them recover from their losses.\n    \n2.  Legal remedies: In cases where the actions of others have violated the rights of individuals, it may be appropriate to seek legal remedies, such as damages or injunctions, to hold those responsible accountable for their actions and to provide compensation to the individuals who have been harmed.\n    \n3.  Counseling and support services: It may be necessary to provide counseling and other support services to individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors in order to help them cope with the emotional and mental trauma they may have experienced.\n    \n4.  Education and training: Providing education and training on human rights and ethical conduct can help to promote a culture of respect and inclusion, and can encourage individuals to act in accordance with these principles.\n    \n5.  Policies and procedures: Having clear policies and procedures in place to address social attack vectors and other forms of abuse can help to prevent harm to individuals and create a more positive and supportive community environment.\n    \n\nBy considering these and other measures, it is possible to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit those who do the right thing and act in support of human rights, rather than benefiting those who engage in social attack vectors for financial or social gain.\n\nIt is also important to have mechanisms in place for addressing and resolving conflicts that may arise within a community of practice, and for holding individuals accountable for their actions. This may involve having processes in place for reporting and investigating incidents of abuse or misconduct, and for taking disciplinary action as appropriate.\n\nIt may also be helpful to have resources available for individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors or other forms of abuse, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n\nOverall, it is important to create a culture of respect and inclusion within a community of practice, and to have policies and procedures in place to address and prevent social attack vectors and other forms of abuse. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive environment for all members of the community and to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected and protected.\n\nA semantic web ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts and relationships within a specific domain of knowledge, using a standardized vocabulary and logical rules. In the context of managing social attack vectors, an ontology could be used to represent concepts such as:\n\n-   Social attack vector: A specific type of behavior or tactic that is used to harm or exploit others, either individually or as part of a group.\n    \n-   Human rights: The fundamental rights and freedoms that are inherent to all human beings, and which are protected under international law.\n    \n-   Financial crimes: Illegal activities that involve the misuse of financial resources or systems for personal or financial gain.\n    \n-   Counseling services: Professional services provided by trained individuals to help individuals cope with and resolve emotional, mental, or behavioral problems.\n    \n-   Legal remedies: Measures that can be taken to address and resolve legal issues, such as damages or injunctions.\n    \n\nBy defining these concepts and their relationships within an ontology, it is possible to create a structured and logical representation of the principles for managing social attack vectors, and to use this representation to support decision-making and other processes related to this domain.\n\n\n### Ontology related
