It is also called record or message in the documentation. When you read or write data to Kafka, you do this in the form of events. Conceptually, an event has a key, value, timestamp, and optional metadata headers. Here's an example event:\n\n-   Event key: \"Alice\"\n-   Event value: \"Made a payment of $200 to Bob\"\n-   Event timestamp: \"Jun. 25, 2020 at 2:06 p.m.\"\n\n**Producers** are those client applications that publish (write) events to Kafka, and **consumers** are those that subscribe to (read and process) these events. In Kafka, producers and consumers are fully decoupled and agnostic of each other, which is a key design element to achieve the high scalability that Kafka is known for. For example, producers never need to wait for consumers. Kafka provides various [guarantees](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics) such as the ability to process events exactly-once.\n\nEvents are organized and durably stored in **topics**. Very simplified, a topic is similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the files in that folder. An example topic name could be \"payments\". Topics in Kafka are always multi-producer and multi-subscriber: a topic can have zero, one, or many producers that write events to it, as well as zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to these events. Events in a topic can be read as often as needed—unlike traditional messaging systems, events are not deleted after consumption. Instead, you define for how long Kafka should retain your events through a per-topic configuration setting, after which old events will be discarded. Kafka's performance is effectively constant with respect to data size, so storing data for a long time is perfectly fine.\n\nTopics are **partitioned**, meaning a topic is spread over a number of \"buckets\" located on different Kafka brokers. This distributed placement of your data is very important for scalability because it allows client applications to both read and write the data from/to many brokers at the same time. When a new event is published to a topic, it is actually appended to one of the topic's partitions. Events with the same event key (e.g., a customer or vehicle ID) are written to the same partition, and Kafka [guarantees](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics) that any consumer of a given topic-partition will always read that partition's events in exactly the same order as they were written.\n\n![](https://kafka.apache.org/images/streams-and-tables-p1_p4.png)\n\nFigure: This example topic has four partitions P1–P4. Two different producer clients are publishing, independently from each other, new events to the topic by writing events over the network to the topic's partitions. Events with the same key (denoted by their color in the figure) are written to the same partition. Note that both producers can write to the same partition if appropriate.\n\nTo make your data fault-tolerant and highly-available, every topic can be **replicated**, even across geo-regions or datacenters, so that there are always multiple brokers that have a copy of the data just in case things go wrong, you want to do maintenance on the brokers, and so on. A common production setting is a replication factor of 3, i.e., there will always be three copies of your data. This replication is performed at the level of topic-partitions.\n\nThis primer should be sufficient for an introduction.
