I have a library of PDFs (public) but they often don’t fit ‘neatly’ into one category alone. This could be resolved via semantic tagging, that could be achieved via systems of various levels of sophistication.\n\n1.  The ability to tag a document (entire file) as being related to a list of categories / topics. \n    \n2.  The ability to tag / annotate a paragraph, chapter or section of a document to relate to particular topics / concepts.\n    \n\n3.  Often, I’m looking to copy/paste and/or get references to papers going on about the same thing I’m writing about.  There’s presently - not very good ways to achieve this process, easily.\n    \n\n1.  The ability to automatically support bibliographical additions; and, linkages between particular elements to the originating document, so that they’re able to be reviewed side-by-side to the created document\n    \n\n5.  Ideally, there’d be a ‘split screen’ process (at least) that allows a person to review an existing article of some type and then link concepts into a new document being produced.  \n    \n\n1.  This may be annotations but it may also be sorta - reverse annotations - where the look-up - is about seeking supportive underlying prior-works - to support claims being made in a new document.\n    \n\n7.  Ideally also - the ability to analyse what’s ‘new’ content vs. what’s a ‘new publication’ of an ‘old work’ could be transparently provided, in some way - save some circumstances where it may be done in a permissive way (ie: clearances / classifications - relating to a series of statements that form a ‘knowledge cloud’ that’s coupled, for coherence purposes...).\n    \n8.  The ability to see both the temporal development of a document, and also the contributors to that document; alongside any discussion linked with the document's evolution. \n    \n\n1.  This would in-turn also support the ability to inspect information about the contributors - subject to permissions, etc. \n    \n\n10.  The ability to create the aforementioned ‘knowledge clouds’ about particular subjects. \n    \n\nRequirements\n\nWe need an ability to use AI in connection with cataloguing human knowledge in a manner that is supportively additive rather than repetitive & disassociative.   \n\nThe challenge is in-turn about seeking to form a method that identifies intentional plagiarism rather than accidental or entirely unknown acts of duplication.  \n\nThese end indices have different sorts of sentiment analysis outcomes.  Using ‘Human Centric’ Methodologies, decisions should always be made by natural persons or a group of natural persons; not otherwise.  \n\nThis means the systems need to present the evidence for persons to review and consider in-order to make a decision on the subject / topic presented to them.  \n\nThe ability and form of determination may change overtime, based on the information available to those involved in making a determination.\n\n**","excerpt":"HyperMedia Library
