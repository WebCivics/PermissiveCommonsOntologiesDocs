A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'.\n\nIt is noted that in some juristictions the term 'person' may refer to a natural person (human being) or a 'legal personality' (Incorporated Entity (such as a company) / legal person). \n\nIn legal terms, an agent is defined to mean;\n*One who agrees and is authorized to act on behalf of another, a principal, to legally bind an individual in particular business transactions with third parties pursuant to an agency relationship.*\n\nSource: https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/agent\n\nAs such, the term 'agent' is intended to provide a distinction between the entity, person or 'actor' (ie: software / \"Ai Agent\") that is performing some sort of task or activity; and the role in which that agent is undertaking that task.  \n\nWhilst there are many senarios where the concept of Agent Centric semantics apply, one example is;\n\n*a natural person in their own private capacity may hold some particular belief or moral position about something, circumstance, etc.  If they are acting on behalf of an employer or other entity; they may be required to carry out tasks in a particular way that may not be of their own choosing.*  \n\n### Entity Centric\n\nEntity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.).  \n\nThis is interactive with both agent and human centric semantics; whilst seeking to support a structural framework around defining how systems are developed to support a means to associate the activities, rights and responsibilities of an entity as does exist in our offline socio-economic world, to be supported in being able to maintain the same principles based structure online, in webizen environments. \n\n\n","excerpt":"The Concept of 'centricity' refers to structuring a way of thinking about the socially-interactive semantics layers.
