Recognition of skills and expertise: AI agents can be used to assess the skills and expertise of knowledge workers and issue Open Badges to recognize their learning and achievements. This can help to provide evidence of skills and abilities that may be difficult to demonstrate through traditional methods.\n    \n2.  Verification of learning: Open Badges can be used to verify the learning and achievements of knowledge workers, helping to ensure that their skills and expertise are accurately represented.\n    \n3.
