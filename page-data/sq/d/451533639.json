It is a complex project, that seeks to (finally) deliver a useful software environment, which will in-turn invoke opportunities to produce and make available specified hardware and software solutions that are designed to support the use of the ecosystem.\n\nThe broader objective has been the focus of my work throughout my professional life.  There are many components to various life experiences that have fed indirectly into these designs, and theres been various focused areas of work that have been specifically focused on the development of concepts relating to these designs and design related implications and considerations, overtime. \n\nWhilst somewhat technical in many areas, often related to my career focus to develop a working soluition in this area, in a manner that supports human rights; a major part of the methods process has been to seek to do work that can empower others who do not have 'advanced' technical skills.\n\nAs noted in the [[Work in Progress]] document, this documentation method has been made possible through the means to make use of relatively simple development processes.  Whilst i believe these tools can be developed to support a variety of new functionality (particularly those relating to the webizen project, and in-turn also 'web civics' related activities); the solution appears to be of a kind that makes it relatively easy for others to employ, even if they're not very technical.  This document seeks to provide a tutorial on how to do it. \n\nThis document is seeking to provide information on how others can use the same soft of process to produce works that can in-turn fit into the broader ecosystem. \n\nNOTE:  Work on producing a [[Knowledge Documents]] format is underway, alongside all the other things...\n\n### Documentation Environment Installation Instructions \n\nThis process provides a particular approach; there are many different approaches available, including the means to download [obsidian](obsidian.md) and purchase their [sync and/or publish](https://obsidian.md/pricing) services that are designed to work with the obsidian platform. \n\nThe alternative that i've used is described below;\n\n1. Github: \n\ta. A user needs to set-up a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. \n\tb. Then they need to set-up a github repo to publish their documents #website \n\tc. The user then needs to set-up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Make sure you set the pages link to the gh-pages branch.  Decide whether you want to use the github provided address or add a cname to the dns records of your domainname, sync and add ssl.\n\td. Then they need to download [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/) and clone the repo to a local storage location. \n\n2. Download and install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n\n3. Obsidian Gatsby Website Template.\n\te. I've used the [Obsibian Template for Gatsby Theme Primer Wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/)goto the link and download the zip file.\n\tf. Upzip the files and copy to the local directory you've created using GitHub Desktop. Then goto GitHub Desktop and right click on the project - selecting the option 'open in visual studio code'\n\tg. Edit the ```.layouts/gatsby-config.js``` file to replace the information entered about the author of the template, with the information about your own project / site then save.\n\th. Goto ```.layouts/static``` and edit the ```CNAME``` file with your own information then save; and then, create a logo and replace ```logo.png```.\n\t\t\n4. Download and install Obsidian\n\ta. Once obsidian is installed, a screen will come-up and one of the options will be to 'open folder as vault'.  Do that, and find the folder that you've created using github desktop for the gatsby files.  Open it. \n\n\tb. you should now see a list of the existing content that came with the website template.  You can either delete all those files or manage them in some way useful to you.  (ie: create a directory and put it those files into it, etc ).  Then start using obsidian to create your own files.\n\t\n\tObsidian automatically saves files.  \n\t\n5. Publish or Publish Draft\n\tWhen you're ready, go back to github desktop and you should see that your project has a bunch of updates. In Github Desktop, goto the repo (project) create a 'commit' by providing a summary and description, then d hit 'commit to main'; and push the 'pull' button. \n\t\n\tIf you get an error with  ```workspace.json``` right click and add to .gitignore. \n\t\n\ta. Current Branch: Main - The main branch will build the application, and publish it to gh-pages. \n\tb. drafts: if you want to save your draft, but not publish it - try creating a different branch. \n\t\n\tNOTE: GIT has a learning curve.  I've had some difficulties with it, and i'm still working on it. \n\n\nhope that helps! \n\n**NOTE:** I have had some difficulty with syncing. I have found at times, that work appears to have dissappeared.  In-turn also, i've had challenges with git and git-stash requirements, which has led me to figure out how to find files (work) that have 'gone'; and then go and recover it.  \n\nput simply, you've got to goto the git system files and look at the log; then find the hash for the stash that's been lost; and goto command prompt and type in git branch (name of branch - ie: recovered) and then the hash.  Then after its been recovered, there's a process to merge back with the original files.\n\nWhilst the method explained above is intended to be useful; it may also be better, to keep the local docs seperate from docs uploaded to github: so basically, write the docs in obsidian and store your work in progress in a folder somewhere; then, when you want to upload it - copy those files to the github folder location, overwriting old files.  \n\nThe other issue that i've had is that HTML in files can break gatsby; so, in the github actions section (online in github) you'd need to look at what might have gone wrong if the build fails & then fix it. \n\nI'm therefore thinking about how to apply [[Early Stage Income Strategies]] type concepts to get help for people, although i'm not entirely sure how to do that yet. \n\nIn anycase; that's how this development documentation has been produced for the [devdocs.webizen.org](https://devdocs.webizen.org) site.\n\n\n### NOTES\n\n1.

Some use of [Chat AI](https://chat.openai.com/) has been employed, that has helped a great deal in some ways; whilst also problematic.  \n\nThis REPO is brand new and will be updated continually until it is RADICALLY improved. \n\nThis documentation project / site is located on GitHub.

Whilst i'm aware of many Semantic Web Luminaries, it is most often the case that their skills in this area far outstrip my own.  Whilst i will work on a best efforts basis, i am entirely likely to make mistakes due to the software engineering related skillset not being core to what it is i do best.  \n \n2. Existing Ontologies often refer to URIs that no-longer exist.  other ontologies are very old and now out dated.  A respectful approach to resolving these sorts of issues is desirable.\n\n3. Whilst the ChatGPT Content provides a helpful start to writing content about a topic, it does need to be updated and reviewed; as such, the new pages where this has been used needs to be reviewed (when i get there)...  It has been found to provide garbage RDF relations when providing ontology related results; whilst also providing valuably useful support, for radically improving the productivity metrics for producing ontology works generally. \n\n5. There's alot of work required to identify and thereafter create useful feature / functionality charts that relate to the functionality of various different types of [[Non-HTTP(s) Protocols]] relating to decentralisation of informatics.

Noting, the libraries and/or solutions produced for Webizen will be made permissively available for use more broadly in anycase.   The structure of these folders will change and the works continue to develop.\n\nWhilst almost all (if not all) use-cases relate to the production of technology for the good of humanity (thereby being a 'web civics' project); the focus on the above noted categories specifically - will develop - to provide improved categorisation of works that relate to supporting applications via other platform solutions; which is essentially part of the broader Peace Infrastructure Project Objectives more broadly.  \n\n\n### What is a Use-Case?\n\nIn [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering \"Software engineering\") and [systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering \"Systems engineering\"), the phrase **use case** is a [polyseme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy \"Polysemy\") with two [senses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_sense \"Word sense\"):\n\n1.  A usage scenario for a piece of software; often used in the plural to suggest situations where a piece of software may be useful.\n2.  A potential scenario in which a system receives an external request (such as user input) and responds to it.\n\nThis article discusses the latter sense.\n\nA _use case_ is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in the [Unified Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language \"Unified Modeling Language\") (UML) as an _[actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_(UML) \"Actor (UML)\")_) and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or another external system. In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering \"Software engineering\"), often representing missions or [stakeholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stakeholder \"Project stakeholder\") goals. The detailed requirements may then be captured in the [Systems Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Modeling_Language \"Systems Modeling Language\") (SysML) or as contractual statements.\n\nSource: [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case)\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/Decentralised Ontologies/","title":"Decentralised Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Context of the term Ontologies for this project is about the use of RDF ontologies or moreover 'semantic web' parts.  The Concept of Decentralised Ontologies is about structuring and consequentially providing ontologies via decentralised protocols.\n\nA list of non-http based protocols is illustrated [[Non-HTTP(s) Protocols]] although, different technologies are better suited to different types of applications and in-turn have different requirements, features, flaws and functionality.  Decentralised Ontologies is both part of the broader [[Permissive Commons Tech]] frameworks and a fundamental part of the specification for it.  Whilst the distinctions are somewhat nuanced; the use of ontologies is critical to structuring other forms of commons resources on decentralised protocols as ontologically referenceable information / informatics resources.\n\n#### Background\n\nThere has been a historic and long-term problem with temporal resolution of 'web' (WWW) content.  This problem has also impacted the availability of 'ontologies', which are the structured vocabularies (semantics) that support the development and use of applications that are dependant upon those ontologies.  In-turn also, ontologies change overtime; whereas the HTTP URI may not. \n\nThen there is also the problem that the use of public (hosted somewhere) ontological resources (particularly in relation to 'commons' information) is often accessed via an API during runtime.  So, the implication becomes a form of API based survellience in relation to activities of humans. \n\nSo in summary; It is desirable to have,\n1. ontologies stored locally (or at least within a 'private network' env) \n2. An ability to manage 'versions' of an ontology that remain 'static'\n3. An ability to assert access control (Read/Write/Append); in a manner that takes into account social factors (ie: stewards vs. consumers / dependents)\n\nSo the purpose of decentralised ontologies (which is part of the Permissive Commons ecosystems) is to create an information systems framework that supports the ability for different authoritative actors / agents (inc. groups) to produce different ontologies and manage the authorship of them; whilst also enabling users to download a copy of those ontologies for use locally (with a semantic / AI agent); and therefore also, any applications that depend upon those ontologies being available, no-longer rely upon whether they're still availalbe on the HTTP URI where they were originally published; but rather, on the DLT (decentralised ledger technology) still being available somewhere.  "},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/Ontology Modelling/","title":"Ontology Modelling"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Ontology modeling is the process of creating a structured representation of a domain of knowledge. An ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to define the vocabulary of a domain, as well as the types of relationships that can exist between concepts.\n\nOntologies are typically created using a formal language, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). They can be used to represent a wide range of knowledge, including scientific, medical, and even business knowledge.\n\nThere are several benefits to using ontologies in modeling a domain of knowledge. They allow for the creation of a common vocabulary that can be shared by multiple users or systems. They also enable the creation of more precise and unambiguous definitions of concepts, which can improve communication and understanding within a domain. Finally, ontologies can be used to enable automated reasoning, allowing computers to make inferences and draw conclusions based on the knowledge represented in the ontology.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/Permissive Commons/","title":"Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Permissive Commons is in-fact similar to the [Decentralised Ontologies](Decentralised%20Ontologies.md) however the scope of 'hyper-media' assets is broader than simply any RDF based assets; and the two are interoperable.\n\nThe Permissive Commons concept is like an advancement of 'open-data', whilst adding more functionality as a consequence of the abillity to use permission structures in relation to assets.\n\nPermissive Commons related documents;\n- [[Permissive Commons Tech]]\n- [[Open Data v3.0 Permissive Commons]]\n- [[Tech for Permissive Commons]]\n\nThere are a few different 'usecases' relating to the use of 'permissive commons'. \n\n**The Public Commons**\nThe first is what would generally be considered 'open data' or information / artifacts of knowledge that pertain to and/or are counterparts to the essential knowledge artifacts required to support human rights.  \n\nThe historical context of what these sorts of assets 'look like'; include but are not limited to,\n\n1. Languages\n2. Encylopedias (knowledge about our biosphere)\n3. Liberal Arts related artifacts\n4. STEM related artifacts (including but not exclusive to statistics)\n5. Laws\n6. Works that are no-longer protected by Copyright Rights (public domain works)\n\nThe nature of how these assets are made available online has changed the 'media format' of the content in various ways.  This in-turn produces an array of new 'functionality' or artifact constituencies that did not exist in previous media (plural of medium) formats, as is illustrated in various types of formats both online and in physical and/or inter-personally communicated formats.   Historically, there has generally been a publisher of whatever the artifacts are; although, the fuller body of knowledge about that particular topic or thing, may have artifacts create / published by many entities. \n\nMore recently, an incredibly significant dependence has developed upon the use of a few websites only to make available 'commons' information.  \n\nIn almost all circumstances, the abillity to add more information about something to 'commons' resources - requires some sort of permission or indeed also, attribution - even if only to protect from the potential implications of wrong-doers... \n\nIn other circumstances, its quite important that there is a valid 'authority' associated to the publication of some kind of commons resource; an example could be the legislative information about a particular law made by a government / parliament in some particular juristiction; where the ability to read is made public, and the application of the 'law' is intended to be defined upon all people; but that the creation of that law, requires a particular process involving specified persons.\n\nIn other situations; for example, the development of a software project using 'github' or similar; or the collaborative development of a document or spreadsheet using an application like 'google docs', the permission structures may be different; indeed, it may be restricted to a particular group or components may be restricted to a particular group (ie: the development of a new version). SO, whilst these sorts of examples are still 'commons' between those people involved; it is also 'permissioned' in a particular sort of way.  This then brings about a consideration about how new systems may in-turn offer solutions for problems that haven't been able to be addressed earlier; such as,\n\n- The abilty to associate compensation to 'knowledge' works, whether that be via a licensing model that applies the same costs equally to all types of 'consumers' or whether it differentiates between different types of consumers, based on particular characteristics, etc. \n\n- The ability to track a process of compensating a person for useful works in a way, that can support the ability to employ 'micropayments' via some sort of defined model; to provide fair compensation for work that a person has done, as is defined electronically; and then, once that fair-compensation amount has been renumerated, the license / permissions are changed.  The point being, that people who do work for the good of humanity should be paid fairly for their useful contributions; but that also, they should not be paid in perpetuity as to seek rents, in a way that would harm the ability to support 'freedom of thought'.  \n\n**Technical Description**\n\nPermissive commons uses a variety of different DLT (Decentralised Ledger Technologies) protocols, noting different protocols better suit different types of applications / use-cases. \n\nEach 'entity' has its own 'graph' (pointed graph); whereby elements of that graph can be downloaded to parse the machine-readable format of the data-structures for use by the local agent (or a linked agent within a users personal or 'trusted' network).\n\nConcept or Entity Centric \"Containers\"\n\nAn example is to describe a particular type of Plant; i'll pick a Melaleuca.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaleuca\n\nTherein - the 'permissive commons' container(s) for that 'thing' would include all sorts of information that describes all the different bits and pieces of information known about a mellaleuca; including, both microscopic & macroscopic information; and the ability to store 'identification' information for use by a AI processor (ie: to identify any melaleuca in photos, etc.).\n\nThis then employs the ontological structures to support AI processing for the information about whatever the topic is; and, users are then able to produce new content, that references via URIs the concepts that they're communicating in a manner that is linked to the graph about that particular topic, concept or thing.\n\nThe storage of information about each 'concept' is intended to support provonance, and any alterations provide links to previous versions; alongside an ability to form semantic inferencing notations about any meaningful relations between the concepts / topics noted earlier as may be effected by updates. \n\n[Temporal Semantics](Temporal%20Semantics.md)\n\nFor example; is a news-article was written about a particular topic in reliance of a particular 'fact' that was believed to be 'true' at the time; but later, new information shows that the old assumption was in-fact incorrect.  The permissive commons engine would support the ability to contextualise the information both from a perspective of when that article or piece of content was written; and, as the manifest underlying assumptions or representations - whether it be about the circumstances of that time, or any changes that have happened since - can in-turn be contextualised for observers (users), temporallly.\n\n[Verifiable Claims & Credentials](Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md)\n\nThe verifiable claims element, has various applications / implications; including, the ability to support provonance in relation to who did what; and in-turn, any terms that may relate to those contributions.  \n\n**### About\n\nThe concept of permissive commons is predicated upon the concept of advancing semantic web technologies that have a capacity to provide peace infrastructure of international significance. \n\nThe Semantic Web is a collection of techniques and/or technologies that provide a standardised method for producing systems and services that are able to be built to support a world that is predicated upon a presumption of responsibility, opportunity and acknowledgement of members of our human family in relation to the causal relationship between what people do and the impact that has upon other members of our human family.   \n\n### Purpose\n\nWhilst we have historically produced other forms of knowledge (and information) infrastructure to support means for members of our human family to support & be supported by one another to grow and prosper with a shared commitment to peace, law (or lore) and various other socioeconomic requirements; the mainstream method that has become increasingly important has been the development of ‘internet communications technology infrastructure’ as a primary form of media for verifiable communications.\n\nThe development and widespread deployment of these tools and related apparatus has resulted in changes of great significance that impact all life on earth.  These changes presently display various characteristics where the performance achieved through the use of modern technology far exceeds what was possible without it, however this is not universally the case.  There are various other characteristics of our societies prior to the growth of these new mediums (collectively - media) that have not prospered. In some cases, there are aspects to societies that were highly valued that have been consumed, exploited and allowed to deteriorate in ways that are known to be supportive for some, whilst a cause of harm for others.  The characteristics of beneficiaries and those who have been consumed, is many, it is broad. \n\nThere are concepts such as ‘truth telling’ that have been dispensed with, to support beneficiaries that have preferred to ensure that is not amongst the features most valued by the things they have made.\n\nThere are societal values, like human rights concepts that have been largely dispensed with, benefiting some who are of a particular character that best supports means to care-less-ly seek revenue, profits. \n\nThere are social resources, like language - that have too often been intentionally misused & abused via systems that seek to apply ‘projections’ upon the many, whilst maintaining systems of control via a small group of artificial actors.  These artificial actors (legal entities / companies) were historically operated by human beings as incorporated persons (as it is called in the USA & similar) did not have facility to employ active - artificial agents, which has been considered a problem & solutions are emerging for it. \n\nThese works are fundamentally supported as a consequence of the mindsphere of natural persons, of members of our human family, whose incentives frameworks as have been acted upon, demonstrably illustrate a series of ideologies that are able to be characterised - at least, theoretically if not practically.\n\nThroughout human history, there has always been an acknowledged requirement to support different groups of people who are able to be distinguished by a common set of values illustrated by those groups; and to seek to ensure that there is a capacity for different groups of people, to hold different ‘values frameworks’; who are in-turn sought to be supported as to peacefully interact with one another without requiring a common agreement that would invalidate people of a particular group, rather, that the focus has been on seeking to ensure means to distinguish between persons who act in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of peaceful relations, from those whose behaviours are not peaceful or reasonably directed / acted / engaged with - on a basis that is equipped to supply peaceful outcomes, morally.  Therein, is a situation where the concept of ‘moral’ or ‘morality’ becomes invoked; as does in-turn also, relate to the concepts historically illustrated via tamper-evidence means called law.\n\nWhilst there is an array of infrastructure that has developed over time to support societal requirements; as is in the interests of all members of our human family, many of these infrastructure requirements are not reasonably supported via these new mediums.  Regardless of whether or not it's distasteful, they’re designs that have developed as a consequence of what has been defined to be important by its designers.\n\nIt is my belief that there is now an opportunity to better define an alternative modality that can support members of the human family who are seeking an alternative knowledge technology infrastructure solution, a solution that those members may consider to be better equipped to support their means to live, grow and prosper in an environment where part of their time is spent both using and improving peace infrastructure projects; that meaningfully benefit the lives of others, done in association to values that cannot be easily illustrated via the infrastructure provided by the leaders of platforms as defined today. \n\nLawful Rights to; seek to ensure,\n\n-   Safety & infrastructure to support ones ability to protect life & rights.\n    \n-   The timely arbitration of Justice in courts of law.\n    \n-   The desire to ensure our economic system protects the right for proper compensation to be provided to a person who has acted lawfully whilst subjected to wrongs by actors whose behaviours should be able to be determined in a court of law by judge and/or jury of ones peers.\n    \n-   That behaviour is illustrative of knowingly seeking to engage in harm or to undermine law; not warrant greater benefit and/or impunity for reasons that seek by financed acts, lawful impunity.\n    \n-   Those wrongs committed via artificial beings, whether active (ie: software / AI) or by sophisticated legal and/or financial means - regardless of how few or how many are disaffected; are sought to be associated with the natural persons who were fundamentally involved in executing such wrongs. That our society is not defined in a manner that seeks to discourage / mute, concepts such as law.\n    \n\nWhilst my words may be inelegant and/or of a draft nature that could always be improved with more work; the underlying reality becomes, that there are already many very good instruments that exist, and whilst they’re not able to be made employable usefully enough online or socio-economically in our world; there is a capacity to employ the tools made by people of different values, to produce tools that are able to provide different sorts of ‘user experiences’. It is thereafter considered important to note, that an array of nomenclature does indeed need to be defined, or specifically re:defined should ‘words’ have become commonly used for purposes / meaning, that are considered different to the science or purpose of any such words at a time of origin.**\n\n#Privacy #socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/Understanding Ontologies/","title":"Understanding Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nIt seems important to describe the consequence of 'ontology' not simply from a technical level, but also from a social level...\n\nFrom a social perspective, an ontology is a shared understanding or interpretation of the world and the concepts that exist within it. It is shaped by the cultural and social context in which it is developed, and it reflects the values, beliefs, and assumptions of the people who create it.\n\nIn sociology, the concept of ontology is often used to refer to the way that individuals and groups make sense of the world and their place within it. This includes their understanding of the nature of reality, the categories and concepts that they use to make sense of the world, and the relationships between these concepts.\n\nIn social interactions, individuals and groups often have different ontologies, reflecting their different experiences and perspectives. These differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, as people may use different terms and categories to describe the same thing, or may have different assumptions about the nature of reality.\n\nHowever, ontologies can also be shared and negotiated through social interactions, as individuals and groups engage in dialogue and communication. Through these interactions, people can come to a shared understanding of the world and the concepts that exist within it, allowing them to communicate more effectively and collaborate more effectively.\n\nOne of the best examples i know of was done by [Jason Silva: Shots of Awe](https://www.youtube.com/@ShotsOfAwe) \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nA discussion about the concept\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HTw3jocJBrw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/Web Science/","title":"Web Science"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The primary way through which Web Science works are sought to be progressed, is moreover via WebCivics activities, as is distinct to the creation of the specifically branded solutions ecosystem that is intended to support the production of technology for the public good via the [[Webizen Alliance]] and related works that are moreover about the [[PCT-Webizen Tech Stack]] specifically (ie:  [[Webizen 3.0]], [[Webizen 3.5]], etc), whilst being informed by WebCivics / WebScience works seek to address the broader [[Social Factors]] and provide practical outcomes that can be made to work via Webizen systems, and others that seek to support the values.\n\n### What is Web Science?\n\n![[webscience.jpeg]]\nSource: A [tweet](https://twitter.com/sotonWSI/status/1172458143428816896) \"Keynote with [@DameWendyDBE](https://twitter.com/DameWendyDBE) ‘Web Science, AI and the Future of the Internet’ at [#WWSSS19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWSSS19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  [@sotonWSI September 13, 2019](https://twitter.com/sotonWSI/status/1172458143428816896)\"\n\nBelow is a definition of 'Web Science' as provided by  [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) .\n\nWeb Science is an interdisciplinary field that studies the social, technical, and economic aspects of the World Wide Web and the internet. It combines elements of computer science, information science, sociology, economics, and other disciplines to understand the complex social, technical, and economic systems that make up the web.\n\nWeb Science researchers study topics such as the structure and evolution of the web, the impact of the web on society and culture, and the ways in which the web can be used to support research, education, and business. They also study the technical and social challenges associated with building and maintaining the web, such as privacy, security, and misinformation.\n\nWeb Science is a relatively new field, and it is still evolving. However, it is an important area of study, as the web and the internet have become increasingly central to many aspects of modern life, and understanding their impact and potential is crucial for both academia and society as a whole.\n\nWeb Science research often involves the use of computational methods and data analysis to study the web and the internet. This can include the use of machine learning algorithms, network analysis techniques, and data visualization tools to understand patterns and trends on the web.\n\nWeb Science also often involves the use of qualitative methods, such as interviews and surveys, to understand the human experience of the web. This can include studying the ways in which people use the web, the impact of the web on society and culture, and the ways in which people interact with each other online.\n\nWeb Science research often focuses on a range of different domains, including social media, e-commerce, online education, and health care. It is an interdisciplinary field, and researchers often collaborate with experts from a variety of fields, such as computer science, sociology, and economics, to tackle complex problems and issues related to the web.\n\nOverall, Web Science is a broad and rapidly evolving field, with a focus on understanding the complex social, technical, and economic systems that make up the web, and the ways in which these systems impact society and individuals.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n### A Quick Introduction to the concept of Social Machines\n\nThe Luminary in the field, James Hendler, wrote a book about [\"Social Machines: The Coming Collision of Artificial Intelligence, Social Networking, and Humanity\"](https://g.co/kgs/FjikkY) .  \n\nBelow is a video that is available in relation to his works sometime ago, that may make more sense to others now...\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVkhX5t98Ls\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIMHO: Generally speaking, the field of work that is structured to in-turn make use of the deep knowledge of different diciplinary areas of thoughtful consideration, as to support the growth of a form of intentional design - in activities that relate to the fabrication of technologies that societies become inextricably linked to, is described as 'Web Science'.\n\nWeb Science works, is in-particular - a significant part of the field of work of Web Civics.  \n\nOne of the greatest areas of 'Web Science' is AI and in-turn also, the work i've been doing that is in-turn instrumental to the architecture of Webizen, as to support [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]].   Nonetheless, the underlying nature of Webizen is that it is a form of Social Machine that is sought to be intentionally designed to provide the sorts of Artificial Minds that we want, rather than providing an opportunity to be influenced by harmful robots. \n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/What are 'The Commons'/","title":"What Are 'The Commons'"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n## Introductions\n\n*The Legal intepretation of the term 'commons' is defined as Something that is common is **owned equally by two or more people**, such as a piece of land. A Tenancy in Common is an interest in land wherein at least two people share ownership.* \n\nSource: [legal dictionary](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/common)\n\n#### The Moral Considerations\nIn-effect, the consideration related to the design of [[Webizen]] and [[Peace Infrastructure Project]] related works was, that in-order to protect [[Freedom of Thought]] there needed to be a series of designs to support both [[Human Centric AI]] and in-turn the manifestation of [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]] in a way that supported the [[No Lock-ins]] and broader [[Safety Protocols]] built into the ecosystems.  In-effect, as is one of the many topics of [[The Values Project]] the ability for people to have their fundamental human rights supported in a way that supports principals such as privacy and moreover the requirements people have in-order to support human dignity.  This requires a means to decentralise the publically consumable knowledge of mankind in such a way that provides us, members of our human family as beneficiaries of these bodies of knowledge; to in-effect, be furnished a means to make use of that information using modern societal tools in a way that does not require us to submit to unwanted abuses of human rights. \n\n#### The SocioEconomic Factors\n\nThe way 'commons' information has been developed for use on internet is now highly centralised, not simply at the level of which websites but moreover which jurisitictions; leading to a circumstance where our ability to define reality is highly dependant upon the few persons involved in making laws in one place on earth which have repercussive effects globally.  This is a well known characteristic for many who are significantly involved.\n\nMany of these websites continue to present requests for financial donations to be provided to support their services; and whilst it is absolutely the case that these services are essential, they have also been designed in a particular way which leads to a significant responsibility. \n\nThese systems of donations do not equally consider how the human labour of those involved in creating the materials might also be considered work; and good work, should be paid - but not paid in perpetuiety (ie: not subject to royalties); which in-turn leads to a few mechanisms that manifest, the first is that 'commons' materials become more easily targeted (increasingly on a programmatic basis) by bad actors (humans, organisations, software / AI) to change the records of what humanity depends upon as knowledge, to suit agendas relating to some particular issue that might be happening at any given time.  Given these systems are unlike books; the content can be changed whenever and the ability to see the history is not easy.\n\nOverall; there are a few variables that relate to issues that have manifested as a consequence of the 'commons' now becoming managed by systems that are so globally centralised legally.\n\n### The Technical Factors\n\nIn-order to support [[Human Centric AI]] and [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]] commons information needs to be formatted into [[Semantic Web]] standards related formats, and this should be done in a way where it is clear who defined the content of the resource (ie: a human being, a company or legal entity or a software agent); and then it needs to be able to be processed locally, without providing constant updates to the providers of any such resources that are essential for the use of computing systems in life.  \n\n## Introductory Summary\n\n> Imagine if, we were only able to be entitled to use the English Language if we agreed to use a spell-checker that constantly provided to an `overlord` the information we generate about everything that we were using the english language to perform, as a requirement for using the english language...   \n> \n> This is one of many constituencies to the far broader 'commons' which permissive commons systems seek to ensure, are able to be used locally without providing any one any information about how we're using it at the time when we're using it; whilst then also, providing a means to create AI related functionality for the things that we end-up sharing with others; once we've decided to do so, and only in relation to the use of those works in relation to whomever it is we've decided to share it with.  \n\n\n## External References\n\nBelow are some definitions sourced elsewhere...\n\n#### WikiPedia: Commons\n\nThe **commons** is the [cultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture \"Culture\") and [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature \"Nature\") resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable Earth. These resources are held in common even when owned privately or publicly. Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism.[cite 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-ReferenceA-1) Commons can also be [defined as a social practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#Commoning_as_a_process \"Commons\")[cite 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-:0-2) of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates.[cite 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-3) \n\n\n### Wikipedia: Digital commons\n\nMain article: [Digital commons (economics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics) \"Digital commons (economics)\")\n\n[Mayo Fuster Morell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Fuster_Morell \"Mayo Fuster Morell\") proposed a definition of digital commons as \"information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be (generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity.

Then the other issue is that the structure of the files haven't been defined using RDF [[Ontologies]] so, it is more difficult or more expensive (time/energy) to create software that can make use of this information with other datasets. \n\n[[Permissive Commons]] uplifts Open-Data towards [[Open Data v3.0 Permissive Commons]].\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/DIDs/","title":"DIDs"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The concept of Decentralised IDentifiers was first raised on the [W3C WebPayments Mailing list in 2014 by Manu Sporny](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014May/0033.html) who originally registered the [URI Scheme with IANA](https://web.archive.org/web/20181225121742/https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/did)\n\n(whilst i'm noted - often the context of these calls was that they were held in the early hours of the morning (ie: 3AM Sydney/AU Time)).\n\nwhilst the works have developed significantly, there are some particular use-cases relating to a concept called [Self Sovereign Identity](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html) that has been the primary focus of these works.\n\nWhilst i am supportive of the use of a method to support non-http uris for resources that make use of linked data / RDF and related ecosystem technologies, i am presently unsure whether and/or how well, the DID specifications now provide a fit-for-purpose solution, and there's been some fairly emotionally explosive history, relating to the history of this tech.\n\n- IANA: https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/did \n- IETF https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mayrhofer-did-dns-05\n- W3C\n\t- Methods Registry: HTML: https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods \n\t- Methods Registry: GitHub: https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/\n\t- W3C Working Group: https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/\n\t- W3C Credentials CG: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/blob/main/work_items.md \n- DIF:  https://identity.foundation/ \n- ID2020: https://id2020.org/\n- Trust Over IP: https://trustoverip.org/\n- Mastercard \n- GS1: \n- Microsoft: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/decentralized-identity\n\nand many others...

The earlier history involved works on [Web Payments Standards](https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/) which led to [Credentials CG](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/) which was originally focused on Verifiable Claims and improving the [[Open Badges]] standards; which overtime led to DIDs.\n\nPrior to the creation of Decentralised Identifiers, previous projects included WebDHT and HTTPA.  The hope was that DIDs were going to be the solution for providing permissive commons; however in more recent years, the works appear to have taken a turn towards being defined by many as 'Decentralised IDentity' which has some percieved problems, that i do not like or support; noting, that the underlying issues relating to these percieved problems are complex, and that i very much support the ability to have Verifiable Claims and Verifiable Credentials.\n\nDIDs are also very closely related to various #Web3 and #Web5 works, that aren't actually about the use of the World Wide Web very much at all - whilst noting again, the complexities involved.  Perhaps most of all; an ecosystem using [[Verifiable Credentials]] and [[DIDs]] emerged and had a significant global role in the global promotion, that at times resulted in enforced requirements for people to be delegated 'Vaccine Passports' which appears to have been directly tied to newer members involved in the production of these technologies.  \n\nThis had the effect of breaching what i considered to have been a previously considered problem (at the time when works were seeking to advance [[Verifiable Credentials]] to become a chartered W3C Activity ) that i thought was agreed, would not be employed as a 'go to market' usecase.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/992760121&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ubiquitous-au\" title=\"Timothy Charles Holborn\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Timothy Charles Holborn</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ubiquitous-au/credentialscgtelecon2015-06-02medical\" title=\"CredentialsCGTelecon2015 - 06 - 02Medical\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">CredentialsCGTelecon2015 - 06 - 02Medical</a></div>\n\n## External Descriptions of DID Technology\n\n\n### Wikipedia: What are DIDs?\n\n**Decentralized identifiers** (DIDs) are a type of globally unique [identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier \"Identifier\") that enables an [entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity \"Entity\") to be identified in a manner that is [verifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials \"Verifiable credentials\"), persistent (as long as the DID controller desires), and does not require the use of a centralized [registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry \"Domain name registry\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier#cite_note-W3_did-core-1) DIDs enable a new model of decentralized [digital identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity \"Digital identity\") that is often referred to as [self-sovereign identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity \"Self-sovereign identity\") or [decentralized identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identity \"Decentralized identity\").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier#cite_note-DID-EU-2) They are an important component of [decentralized web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_web \"Decentralized web\") applications.\n\nSource: [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier)\n\n### W3C: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0\n#### Core architecture, data model, and representations\n\n[Decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers). In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers), the design enables the controller of a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party. [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) are [URIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-uri) that associate a [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects) with a [DID document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.\n\nEach [DID document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) can express cryptographic material, [verification methods](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verification-method), or [services](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-service), which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a [DID controller](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-controllers) to prove control of the [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers). [Services](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-service) enable trusted interactions associated with the [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects). A [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) might provide the means to return the [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects) itself, if the [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects) is an information resource such as a data model.\n\nThis document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties, serialized representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent.\n\nSource: [W3C DID CORE Spec Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)\n\n## Concerns\n\nI am particularly concerned about the idea of 'private webs', particularly those built solely upon blockchains - leading to, what many may consider to be 'unintended consequences'.  Intended or otherwise, the consideration is that its best to advoid unwanted consequences.\n\nAs the [DID methods registry](https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/tree/main/methods) somewhat already demonstrates; there has seemingly been a rush to obtain namespaces; and this may in-turn illustrate what may be considered, problematic circumstances.  For instance; the Namespace defined as [did:health](https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/commit/347608e6903fd2c9cc867e6949a86f615f1db266) refers to the information noted below\n\n```\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"health\",\n  \"status\": \"registered\",\n  \"verifiableDataRegistry\": \"DID Health\",\n  \"contactName\": \"support\",\n  \"contactEmail\": \"support@did.healthcare\",\n  \"contactWebsite\": \"https://www.did.healthcare/\",\n  \"specification\": \"https://github.com/didhealth/health-did-resolver/blob/main/doc/did-method-spec.md\"\n}\n\n```\n\nThen, when going to https://www.did.healthcare/ the site is redirected to: https://rimmo.co/ (an e-commerce shop)\n\nIn the example for the term [DID:ID](https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/commit/1fdde3119fd968b496f5ab104994eea09222ffef), the method is registered to Mastercard.\n\n``` \n\n{\n    \"name\": \"id\",\n    \"status\": \"registered\",\n    \"verifiableDataRegistry\": \"ID Service\",\n    \"contactName\": \"Mastercard\",\n    \"contactEmail\": \"\",\n    \"contactWebsite\": \"https://idservice.com/en/contactus.html\",\n    \"specification\": \"https://github.com/Mastercard/did-methods/blob/master/id.md\"\n}\n\n```\n\n\nnote also: https://github.com/microsoft/did-ccf/blob/main/DID_CCF.md\n \nThere are other examples; yet, yet without spending more time on the details; it may well be that the way the `did` specification has been developed, are not fit for purpose for PCT-ONT.\n\nNonetheless, more investigation is required to better evaluate the decentralised nature of decentralised identifiers, etc. \n\nAs noted, I was personally very emotional about the global rollout of 'vaccine passports' and the entire situation disaffected me greatly, as such i do have personal views - which i am entitled to have and express - whilst seeking to do so, clearly - rather than doing otherwise.\n\n*NOTE:  These works are only loosely coupled to the psychological concept of [Disassociative Identity Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder) particularly with respect to the [[Webizen]] and [[Peace Infrastructure Project]] scope of works which actively seeks to address [[Social Attack Vectors]] related issues; including but not limited to Human Trafficking ( Note: [UNODC: Anti-Human Trafficking Manual for Criminal Justice Practitioners](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/2009/anti-human-trafficking-manual.html) ) and other forms of abuse that are closely tied to Severe Mental Illness as defined by the [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) publications; including but not limited to DID.*\n\n##### jurisdictions \n\nIn-order to support inter-national world order, whereby each UN recgonised member state (at a minimum) is supported in being provided the means to manage their electronic affairs domestically; particularly where such sorts of requirements relate to such things as legislative records, then i am unsure how a URI structure registered by an organisation like Mastercard may reasonably support the [[Centricity]] related requirements - at this time...  Perhaps there's something that i've missed and simply do not understand, however, it is not obvious to me how these solutions provide support for sovereignty in any meaningful way broadly. \n\n### Possible Solutions - A Draft Note\n\nThe underlying methodology for defining how a decentralised ontology (PCT-ONT) standards compatible system works, may simply provide a series of ontological references that in-turn enable the client (end users) to get the resource from whatever network they prefer to use themselves; thereby, leading to a situation where the information can be collected from a range of different networks, rather than solely being available on one network (ie: DID:ID).\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/Non-HTTP(s) Protocols/","title":"Non-HTTP(s) Protocols"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Non-HTTP(s) Protocols are helpful for [Decentralised Ontologies](Decentralised%20Ontologies.md), [Permissive Commons](Permissive%20Commons.md), [Verifiable Claims & Credentials](Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md) and in-turn also support for various forms of [Currencies](Currencies.md) (including Micro-Payments), although not exclusively.\n\nA List of examples and candidates include; but are not exclusive to,\n\nNon-HTTP(s) protocols that run over internet are various, some are 'blockchains' many are not; yet broadly, they're called Decentralised Ledger Tables.\n\nSome examples include; in no particular order,\n\n- [Lightning Network](Lightning%20Network.md)\n- [[Chia]]\n- [[Hedera]]\n- [[IOTA]]\n- [[obyte]]\n- [[XRP Ledger]]\n- [[NYM]]\n- [DAT](DAT.md)\n- [IPFS](IPFS.md)\n- [WebTorrent](WebTorrent.md)\n- [GIT](GIT.md) as is used for GitHub / GitLab, etc. \n\nObviously also, there's also major 'crypto currency' focused protocols like [BitCoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) and [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum).  \n\nOthers, are still useful and important; but not DLTs, for example,\n\n- [GUNECO](GUNECO.md)\n\nThis list is incomplete. \n\nThe methods are not seeking to suggest that any particular protocol (ie: web3 stuff) shouldn't be supported; but rather, that the design of these webizen systems requires HTTP(s) support. \n\nHTTP based protocols are also alot faster than many DLT solutions (depending on networking issues, etc.); and, part of the objective purpose of the [[PCT-Webizen Tech Stack]] is to advance the 'World Wide Web' based ecosystems (Semantic Web --> Social Web) as is distinct to creating an alternative to the World Wide Web and/or potentially also by extension - an alternative to Internet - through the primary use of alternative protocols as a priority.  There are many potential threats and underlying complexities that exist in relation to the emergence of new 'global' protocols, that are different to the sorts of characteristics that exist in relation to existing systems and services.  As such, a balance needs to be struck as to support scalability, which is a technically dynamic issue that is mostly defined via [[Social Factors]].\n\nAs is noted otherwise in the [[Engineering Considerations]] document; there is a great deal of deliberation going into figuring out how to ensure optimidation of [[Energy Calcs]]. \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/Open Badges/","title":"Open Badges"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Open Badges are digital badges that can be used to recognize and verify learning, skills, and achievements. They are designed to be flexible and portable, so that they can be easily shared and displayed on a variety of online platforms, such as websites or social media profiles.\n\nOpen Badges consist of a digital image file that contains metadata about the badge and the learning or achievement it represents. The metadata may include information such as the badge issuer, the criteria for earning the badge, and the evidence required to demonstrate mastery of the learning or skills.\n\nOpen Badges can be issued by a variety of organizations, including educational institutions, employers, professional organizations, and non-profits. They can be used to recognize a wide range of learning and achievements, including formal educational qualifications, professional certifications, skills development, and community service.\n\nOverall, Open Badges are a useful tool for recognizing and verifying learning and achievements in a digital context, and can help to provide evidence of skills and abilities that may be difficult to demonstrate through traditional methods.\n\nThe [Open Badge Specification](https://1edtech.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html) was formed via [IMS Global](https://www.imsglobal.org/) working with the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/) \n\nTechnically, an Open Badge is a digital image file that contains metadata about the badge and the learning or achievement it represents. The metadata is encoded in the badge image file using a standard called the Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI).\n\nThe OBI allows badges to be easily shared and displayed on a variety of online platforms, as the metadata can be read and interpreted by different systems and software.\n\nTo issue an Open Badge, an organization (such as an educational institution, employer, or professional organization) must first create the badge design and specify the criteria for earning the badge. The badge issuer can then use a badge-issuing platform, such as the Open Badges Platform, to create and issue badges to individuals who have met the specified criteria.\n\nIndividuals who receive an Open Badge can then display the badge on their own websites or social media profiles, or share it with others. When someone clicks on the badge image, they can access the metadata about the badge, including information about the issuer, the criteria for earning the badge, and any relevant evidence or documentation.\n\nOverall, Open Badges work by combining a digital image file with metadata encoded using the OBI, allowing badges to be easily shared and displayed on a variety of online platforms and providing information about the badge and the learning or achievement it represents."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/Open-Data/","title":"About Open Data"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# About Open Data\n\nThere's an array of existing Open-Data sources that are provided from various groups. \n\n\nA fuller list will be pr"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/Semantic Web/","title":"Semantic Web"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Semantic Web is a vision for the future of the World Wide Web in which the meaning and relationships between data on the web are explicitly defined and can be understood by machines.

These technologies allow data on the web to be represented in a structured and semantically meaningful way, enabling machines to understand the relationships and meanings of the data.\n\nThe Semantic Web has the potential to enable a wide range of new applications and services, such as intelligent search engines, personalized recommendations, and intelligent agents that can act on behalf of users.

IE: The fact is, i have this 'verifiable claim' that was generated in relation to XYZ or XYZ circumstance, it clearly states 'these things' or provides 'xyz' information from \"Alice\" or 'bob' or 'acme .inc' which may be used as a instrument for electronic contracts.\n\n### Verifiable Claims\nVerifiable claims are digital statements that can be cryptographically proven to be true or false. They are used to enable secure and trustworthy exchanges of information on the internet, and are an important building block for a variety of applications, including digital identity systems, online reputation systems, and supply chain management.\n\nVerifiable claims are typically created using digital signatures, public key infrastructure (PKI), and other cryptographic techniques. They are structured as assertions about a particular subject (e.g., a person, an organization, a product), and can include information such as the subject's identity, attributes, and relationships.\n\nVerifiable claims are typically issued by a trusted authority, such as a government agency or a certification body. The issuer is responsible for verifying the information contained in the claim and for attesting to its accuracy. The issuer can also use digital signatures or other cryptographic techniques to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the claim.\n\nVerifiable claims can be stored and shared using various technologies, including blockchain, distributed ledger, and secure data storage systems. They can be used to enable secure and efficient exchanges of information between different parties, and to support a wide range of applications, including identity verification, supply chain tracking, and online reputation management.\n\n### Credentials\nA credential is a formal certification or documentation that attests to an individual's qualifications, skills, or achievements. Credentials can be issued by a variety of organizations, including schools, professional associations, and employers, and can be in the form of degrees, certificates, licenses, or other documents.\n\nCredentials are typically used to demonstrate an individual's competence or knowledge in a particular field or area of expertise. They are often required for certain types of employment, professional practice, or other activities that require a certain level of knowledge or skill.\n\nThere are many different types of credentials, including academic degrees (e.g., bachelor's, master's, PhD), professional certifications (e.g., Certified Public Accountant, Registered Nurse), and occupational licenses (e.g., pilot's license, attorney's license). Credentials may also be earned through other means, such as professional development courses, internships, or on-the-job training.\n\nIn addition to being used as evidence of an individual's qualifications, credentials can also serve as a way for organizations to verify an individual's identity and to ensure that they have the necessary skills and knowledge to perform certain tasks or functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols #RuleOfLaw "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/Verifiable Credentials/","title":"Verifiable Credentials"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"W3C Verifiable Credentials: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/\n\n\n\nVerifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital documents that contain information about an individual or entity that can be used to verify their identity or attributes.

When producing content that uses semantic web technologies such as linked-data (rdf), this provides an array of abilities, however the content being authored is not only the content provided by the individual themselves; in a linked-data document, the terms used are provided meaning via ontologies; such as a document discussing flora or fauna, or statistics or law or a particular circumstance; all of these sorts of written works (as an example) relies both upon the writings of the author and in-turn external resources, that are generally intended to be considered from a perspective of the present-tense; as relates, to when that document was authored. \n\nYet the way HTTP / WWW works currently, it is difficult to maintain the [[Temporal Semantics]] or semantic resolution / comprehension, as a consequence of how various websites update or change their content or at times, change their names and no-longer exist.  in other circumstances, the context of the time - is different to the context of a future time; so a link in a webpage describing something, may in-turn refer to an external source that later changes.\n\nThere are many examples of how these sorts of issues results in an inability to maintain knowledge artifacts via current-day web-sources (http / www).  Whilst Archive.org and other sites like it do exist, they become a centralised archive rather than a part of how the internet is made to work - decentralising the responsibility to support these sorts of services, as a component that is as important as other components - such as DNS...  \n\nHistorically also, there has been an 'open data' movement; however these resources are often not made available in a linked-data format; nor are they reliably available and/or verifiable, alongside an array of other qualities that the open-data movement has not seemingly achieved.  So, in response to these issues, [[Permissive Commons]] ecosystems concepts have grown overtime to respond to various issues that otherwise poorly impact [[Freedom of Thought]] and other values and semantics, of importance overall.\n\nSome earlier notes include;\n\n- [[Open Data v3.0 Permissive Commons]] (2019)\n- [[Tech for Permissive Commons]] (2019)\n- [[the-need-for-decentralised-open-linked-data]] (2018)\n\n(other records available )\n\n### Permissive Commons Technology Outline\nPermissive Commons refers to the use of non-http-uris and protocols to support the management of 'commons' information in a manner that employs linked-data to structure consumable assets relating to a particular topic or subject; that supports the following features,\n\n1. The ability to decentralise the use of the information artifacts.\n2. The ability to independently assert read, append, write and delete permissions to different agents based on the context of the information category / type / stakeholder framework.\n3. The ability to support [[Temporal Semantics]] (inclusive to version control)\n4. The ability to make use of different types of protocols, depending on the needs of the producer of the permissive commons assets / content. \n5. The ability to make notations in RDF (linked data) that can point to a particular version of an artifact; and a protocol method that can support the discovery and use of that particular version, even if the original publisher no-longer makes that data available themselves (pending types / methods, etc.)\n6. The ability to support 'rules' about content management (read / append) in a way that is different to read permissions. \n7. The ability to support privacy (/ human dignity).\n\nLinked-Data Ontologies are often difficult to find online, all too often the original location of the namespace has moved or is no-longer available.  As semantic web systems are built using namespaces that are pointed at a particular location where the description of that ontology is intended to exist; when the links become broken, the consequences have a network effect.\n\nWeb 2.0 APIs provide information, whether it be permissioned or public; yet, this method requires users to make specified queries for the information they're looking for at the time of the query; which has an array of privacy implications in addition to the problems noted in relation to the linked-data ontology space issues.\n\nThe concept of 'commons' basically refers to some kind of 'group'.  It could refer to a group of people who live in a particular juristiction, whose governments publish their legislation in a permissive commons format; that provides others the ability to refer to the specific law that existed at a specific time in relation to a contract or other document relating to law is intended to be associated with; in this case, the general public have no ability to modify the records, but they are able to read / consume the records with their Local AI agent. \n\nAnother form of permissive commons may be an array of information about biosphere related things (ie: like wikipedia related assets) or machine learning models; or indeed also, works that relate to a group project, that leads to an ability to support different sorts of business models (note: [[Value Accounting Initiatives]] ). \n\nThe concept of [[Ontologies]] is fairly important to understand; noting, one of the greatest purposes of Permissive Commons, is to support means to decentralise 'group' ontologies (is is distinct to personal ontologies). \n\nThe Development Folder for ontology related work is currently located [here on github](https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023) \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Permissive Commons/Requirements/","title":"Requirements"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nThis document provides an index for the Permissive Commons Technology - Ontologies Ecosystem Requirements Statement.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Work in Progress/Collect Existing Ontologies/","title":"Collect Existing Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Existing Ontologies are currently collected into the [webcivics/ontologies](https://github.com/webcivics/ontologies/tree/2023) repo.

As such, by Interacting with ChatAI i've asked it a few questions...\n\nIt seems to me, that those who seek to discourage people from making technology to support fairness, human rights, etc.  are better off arguing with a robot; which they can do, here's the link - ask it yourself [ChatAI](https://chat.openai.com/)\n\n\n### **Q:** What are the values universally shared by all of humanity worldwide?\n\n**OpenAI**:\n\nIt is difficult to identify values that are universally shared by all of humanity, as people from different cultures and backgrounds may hold different values and beliefs. However, there are some values that are widely considered to be important and are shared by many people across different cultures and societies. These may include:\n\n1. Respect for human rights and dignity: Many people around the world value the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, and believe that every person has certain fundamental rights that must be respected and protected.\n2. Fairness and justice: Many people value fairness and justice, and believe that everyone should be treated equally and with respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n3. Honesty and integrity: Many people value honesty and integrity, and believe that it is important to be truthful and transparent in one's actions and dealings with others.\n4. Compassion and empathy: Many people value compassion and empathy, and believe that it is important to show concern and care for others, and to be understanding and supportive of their needs and experiences.\n5. Responsibility and accountability: Many people value responsibility and accountability, and believe that individuals should be held accountable for their actions and should take responsibility for the consequences of their choices.\n\n### Q: Define Peace Infrastructure.\n\nPeace infrastructure refers to the systems, processes, and institutions that support peace in a society. This can include a variety of different things, such as:\n\n-   Legal frameworks and institutions that promote justice and rule of law\n-   Political systems and processes that encourage dialogue and compromise\n-   Economic systems that support equitable development and distribution of resources\n-   Educational systems that teach non-violent conflict resolution and respect for diversity\n-   Social support systems that provide assistance to vulnerable groups and promote social cohesion\n-   Media systems that report accurately and fairly on conflicts and promote peaceful dialogue\n\nOverall, peace infrastructure refers to the structures and practices that help to prevent and mitigate conflict, promote reconciliation and cooperation, and create a stable and secure environment for individuals and communities.\n\nhere are a few more examples of what can be included in peace infrastructure:\n\n-   Human rights protection: This can include laws and institutions that protect the rights of individuals and groups, as well as advocacy and education efforts to promote awareness and understanding of human rights.\n-   Security forces: These can include law enforcement agencies, military forces, and other security bodies that are responsible for maintaining order and protecting citizens from violence and crime.\n-   Mediation and conflict resolution: This can include processes and institutions that facilitate dialogue and negotiation between parties in conflict, such as mediation centers, peace negotiations, and truth and reconciliation commissions.\n-   Civil society organizations: These can include non-profit organizations, religious groups, and other community-based organizations that work to promote peace and address social issues.\n-   Community policing: This can refer to police programs that focus on building relationships with community members and working with them to address issues of crime and violence.\n\nOverall, building strong peace infrastructure is a complex and ongoing process that requires the involvement and cooperation of a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, civil society, and communities.\n\n\n### **Q:** How would you define the characteristics of human behaviour or an agent, needed to consider it peaceful as is distinct to wrongdoings, violence, negligence and other moral wrongs? \n\n**OpenAI**:\n\nThere are several characteristics that could be considered necessary for an agent (whether human or non-human) to be considered peaceful. These may include:\n\n- Refraining from causing harm to others: A peaceful agent is one that does not engage in activities that cause harm to others, such as physical violence, verbal abuse, or neglect.\n- Respecting the rights and autonomy of others: A peaceful agent is one that respects the rights and autonomy of others, and does not seek to control or dominate them.\n- Seeking peaceful resolution of conflicts: A peaceful agent is one that seeks to resolve conflicts through peaceful means, such as negotiation and mediation, rather than resorting to violence or aggression.\n- Showing empathy and compassion towards others: A peaceful agent is one that is empathetic and compassionate towards others, and seeks to understand and address their needs and concerns.\n- Actively promoting peace and harmony: A peaceful agent is one that actively promotes peace and harmony, and seeks to create conditions in which individuals and groups can coexist in a peaceful and harmonious manner.\n\n### Q: Describe Peace Infrastructure Technology... \n\nOpenAI: \nPeace infrastructure technology refers to the use of technology to support peacebuilding efforts and promote peaceful societies. This can include a variety of different things, such as:\n\n-   Communication technologies: These can include tools like social media platforms, messaging apps, and online forums that allow individuals and groups to connect, share information, and coordinate activities.\n    \n-   Data analysis and visualization tools: These can be used to analyze and present data on issues related to peace and conflict, such as patterns of violence, human rights abuses, and economic indicators.\n    \n-   Mapping and geospatial technologies: These can be used to create maps and visualizations of conflict-affected areas, helping to identify trends, hotspots, and patterns that may not be immediately apparent.\n    \n-   Monitoring and evaluation tools: These can be used to track progress and assess the effectiveness of peacebuilding interventions, such as peace negotiations, reconciliation programs, and economic development projects.\n    \n-   Virtual reality and simulation technologies: These can be used to create immersive training and education experiences that teach skills related to conflict resolution, negotiation, and other aspects of peacebuilding.\n    \n\nOverall, peace infrastructure technology can help to facilitate communication, cooperation, and coordination among peacebuilders, and can provide important tools and resources for understanding and addressing conflicts and promoting peaceful societies.\n\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/","title":"Webizen"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"## What is Webizen?\n\n### Introduction\n\n[Webizen](https://github.com/linkeddata/webizen) 1.0 was a Search Engine. The project, alongside many other related projects were deprecated.  Some of the Resources were protected some time ago and now; redefined...\n\n![[webizen.jpg]]\n\n## The New Webizen\nWebizen is Independent to the project known as Solid (formerally [#rww](https://www.w3.org/community/rww/)) as run by [inrupt](https://www.inrupt.com). \n\nThis folder contains information about the technology stack being produced as [[Webizen 3.0]].  Much as was said to be the case about #RWW & #CrossCloud, #Webizen is likely to have a different sort of approach.  For more information see: [[Work in Progress]]\n\n\n### What does Webizen Mean?\n\nWhen Asking #ChatGPT to define the Term Webizen; it says,\n\n>A webizen is a term used to describe an individual who is actively involved in online communities and who is an active and engaged citizen of the internet. Webizens are often thought of as being proactive and responsible users of the internet, who contribute to online communities in positive ways and help to create a sense of community and connection online.\n>\n>Webizens may be involved in a variety of online activities, such as participating in forums or discussion groups, creating content or media, or engaging with others on social media. They may also be involved in advocacy efforts related to internet governance or online rights and freedoms.\n>\n>Overall, the term webizen is used to describe individuals who are actively involved in online communities and who are committed to being responsible and engaged citizens of the internet.\n\nWhereas; when i consider the term 'Webizen', what i'm thinking about is future [[Artificial Minds]] that are owned by human beings to be their assistant and support their needs. \n\nThe [[PCT-Webizen Tech Stack]] is in-effect, the creation of an ecosystem solution that provides support for [[Human Centric AI]] as is instrumental for [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]] systems.\n\n### About Webizen Systems\nAs this documentation environment presents; The webizen systems, are designed in a particular way to support a particular type of ecosystem outcome that considers both a variety of technology related factors and requirements, in addition to various social factors and related considerations and implications. \n\nThese systems become assembled to provide a different type of Computing Environment, which in-turn provide the opportunity to produce different types of Apps, that have different types of capabilities, functionality and features. \n\nThere are a series of principals relating to structure of these designs.  In-turn, the outcome is far greater than the sum of its parts...  In-effect, the environment provides a different sort of toolkit or apparatus, that is intended to support safety and the safe use of democratised [[Human Centric AI]].   The way this is emboided for social purposes, is that the environment produces an ecosystem solution to support a particular class of [[Artificial Minds]] that are in-turn what it is that the meaning of webizen is intended to define, in future. \n\n### The Future Webizen Agents\n\n![[WebizenPeaceBot.png]]\n\nThe Future Webizen Agents, are a type or class of Artificial Intelligent Agent that have a series of particular qualities; and importantly also, an array of [[Safety Protocols]] that works effectively to ensure that other forms of Artificial Minds are not able to both be called or be made able to work on the [[PCT-Webizen Tech Stack]] and still be compliant with [[The Webizen Charter]].\n\n### Digital Twins vs. Webizen\n\nFor a very long time, the work on forming a 'knowledge banking' (previously called an 'information bank' or 'ibank'); developed in a way where the advent of the term 'digital twin' was adopted in an effort to try to describe the role of an 'inforg' and in-turn the AI extension of a natural person, and the importance of seeking to ensure the ontological design and related social fabric issues were created in a way that could reasonably support Human Dignity.  But this method effectively failed.  The Strength of 'competition' from actors who sought to 'own' people digitally, via their 'digital twin' and related ecosystems, was so strong; and there was a complete lack of viable support for works to produce alternatives.  Further to these issues, when getting stuck into the fields of science of consciousness, the debates that were brought about were almost religious in nature.  Then, there were also technologists (many whom i admire) who were talking about AI being like a human; which, when bonded to the exhibits of how these technologies were being commercialised, led me to fear the implications.   So, these circumstances; which indeed also, i note the volume of remarkable minds who have provided support for me to be engendered with a basis to form insights,\n\nLed me to realise, that there was a pivotal shift that could or moreover should occur. \n\nWhat i needed to do, was to form a means to communicate and support the social development of works (on the [[Social Factors]] ) by refocusing the work via a lens that was focused on seeking to get people to think about what sorts of [[Artificial Minds]] it is that they actually want to create.

These systems produce ‘inforgs’, that support the electromagnetic operation of Human Experience.\n\nAn **inforg** is an informationally embodied organism, entity made up of information, that exists in the [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere \"Infosphere\"). These informationally embodied organisms are also called natural agents. source [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)\nMy core argument is that the present, cloud-computing, silo based architecture is distorting the reality of humanity as a whole, causing significant problems. I have held a strong belief about how it is these problems can be solved, and this website documents the outcomes formed as a result of around two decades of work done on producing (and contributing towards) the tooling for a ‘Human Centric Web’. My theory, has been built upon the underlying theory that our societies need ‘knowledge banking industries’. \n\nI started in 2000 with my idea for an information bank, and over the course of my journey, have had the opportunity to work with many world-leaders overtime, in what has been a remarkable journey.\n\nIn attempting to define the purpose of these works, in latin; *Artificium*’ is defined to mean craft, skill or technology, *corpora* as the plural form of *corpus*, derives from the Latin word for body, or a “body of people” as to have now evolved to the term ”corporation” *Sapientiae* as to mean in plural wisdom; and *Universitas* the word latin word to mean “the whole, total, the universe, the world”.\n\nThe concept of corpus is used in relation to the concept of Persona Ficta which means ‘legal personality’, or legal entities who are not human. \n\nBy extension, the application of law has formed a man-made concept of ‘artificial persons’ that are now attributed legal rights, independent to its relationships with natural persons. \n\nNatural legal persons are of course distinct to any ‘artificial person’ and whilst the original context was formed in the previous generation of (“printing era”) technology and tools; the application of considerations with respect to ‘artificial actors’ now also include ICT agents. \n\nThe purpose of a ‘human centric web’, through the active use of inforgs, is to adapt the use of technology, to progress humanity as a species, in service to our natural world.\n\nThis site is designed to compile the work-product produced; alongside related links and information; in the hope it’ll be useful to others. The site contains libraries of links, videos, books that are available to learn about the global standards based software tooling and related software products; alongside an array of thoughts, business concepts and related theory produced by me.\n\nI hope the dynamic array of consumable hypermedia provides something that can be made useful by people of different fields. from the business and governance related content, to the ICT technical materials made available.\n\nThe scope of these works can more easily be deployed by the global giants already operating the bulk of the technology stack, albeit, without the required legal, economic or consumer interface requirements needed to bring it about.\n\nThis can all change very quickly and I suspect things are about to change.\n\n##### Website Contents\n\nThe Webizen.net.au site contains an array of materials. The ‘information architecture’ of this website has not been done as yet, nor has templating been reviewed in any serious way (i’ve just got something that works, for now).\n\nAll content should be considered draft, and some, employs ‘social encryption’ and can be reasonably considered ‘rubbish’ by those who lack kindness. This is in-part, an intentional practice method that is now being reviewed given the progressive state of works more broadly; and the shift in audience, this site is intended to be made useful to, for proper purpose.\n\nMy practice method has separated materials in the following way;\n\n**constituents**: the ‘constituents’ page lists, posts that have been harvested off my old websites alongside newly created ones. There is a search feature alongside other means to find content produced historically.\n\n**about**: contains more commercially accessible (non-technical) pages that make an attempt to describe the multifaceted nature of the body of work.\n\n**Technical Introductions:** is WIP (work in progress). it is designed to provide technologists, of various skills sets, the means to evaluate the communicated concepts in various forms of technical terms.\n\n**Resource Library**: is also WIP. Some technical work needs to be done (which will be done during the ‘templating’ stage); but this section, is currently designed to provide references to known 3rd party materials (ie: books, code, relevent 3rd party projects) alongside some of my own.\n\n##### SOCIAL ENCRYPTION\n\nAmongst the fields of work that i believe to be amongst my greatest achievements, is the design of a methodology i believe to be quantum resistant; whereby informatics can be secured through a practice method i call ‘social encryption’. This methodology is a multifaceted thing, that by practice theory; has been shown to deliver ‘as intended outcomes’. Put simply, there is a means and methodology to what may otherwise be considered madness.\n\nThis in-turn provides an AI, Quantum Computer and idiot proof; informatics schema, that provides a defensible position against misuse, whilst supporting the means through which SME (subject matter experts) can make sense of it.\n\nThe methodology employs what is in-essence considered to be a form of ‘web science’; that is, a branching methodology that employs psychology as much as it does linguistics, decentralised information systems design; and other qualities, somewhat systematically.\n\nWhen searching this site for something that relates to a field of endeavour you really truely care about; you’ll likely find the resource you need. If you don’t, you won’t. This includes the additional information provided on the site about social encryption. If you don’t understand enough to be able to find it, It won’t make sense to you, you won’t know what to do about it; and that is part of my informatics design demonstrating something, you won’t understand makes sense or how it could be made use of to solve problems.\n\nCoders often suggest the only intellectual property that counts is documentation and working code. In-turn they seek out investors, to pay those they believe more broadly to be irrelevant.\n\nMy work, in part, argues the point; in a far more inclusive way.\n\n###### Disclaimer\n\nThis site is new, raw and a “work in progress”. I have years of work that i need to publish and intend to do so here; but that takes more time than i’ve spent, and as such – this site is still, from a content perspective, incomplete. I also need to refactor my ‘code’ to make it more accessible to others. In-past, i’ve employed an array of techniques now made defunct. As anyone who really knows what its like to do this kinda work will know; The importance of ensuring global, open, patent pool protected standards was (is) extraordinary.\n\nIt is the case today that the tooling required, is available in that format. This wasn’t the case at all when i started; so, please be considerate of the journey.\n```"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/SchemaGen Notes/","title":"SchemaGen Notes"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nBelow is a document that was produced in connection to the brief works on the schema-generator group. \n\n#### SchemaGen CG Info\n\n[W3C Schema Gen CG](https://www.w3.org/community/schema-gen/) \n\nOriginal List: [W3C Schema-Gen](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schema-gen/)\nChat Group: [https://gitter.im/w3cg-schema-gen](https://gitter.im/w3cg-schema-gen) \n\n### Discovery Related updated notes\n\nAn ontology has been found that provides some level of functionality that relates to the concept below.  In another related posts on the [W3C Schema-Gen](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schema-gen/) a poorly communicated illustration relating to discovery (therefore also decentralising search) was briefly noted... \n\n#### The Document about a Discovery Solution\n\nOriginal Link: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13VXBVte-ixR2Ryc9v1g4g2ayk4pkYDHU4hKp_AMpwzA/edit)\n\n**IDEA RE:  PROJECT GROUP - SCHEMA GEN**\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Web of Data provides structured data-level interactivity via WWW using RDF related tools and standards.  The means to resource & identify these tools is challenging for newcomers. \n\nThe use of RDF Tooling is more diverse than is traditional for developers.  Individuals working within libraries, digital agencies and other areas of society should be able to use RDF tools to assist with the development of the Web Of Data.  Developers on the other hand should be able to find, resource and contribute towards the development of RDF tools for use in their own projects and that of others.\n\nThis project seeks to produce a decentralised discovery tool for making discoverable, and finding RDF tools on the web.\n\nPROBLEM\n\nThe development of RDF has occurred over several years.  Whilst information about tooling is available online in many cases tooling links are either dead, point to unmaintained software and are difficult to find. Categories of online resources include; but are not limited to,\n\n-   Sparql EndPoints\n    \n-   Ontologies\n    \n-   Visualisation Services\n    \n-   Schema Generator \n    \n-   Server Platforms\n    \n-   IDEs\n    \n-   Graph Databases\n    \n-   Organisations\n    \n-   Projects  \n\nIDEA - Upgrade robots.txt / sitemap.xml - functionality - Using RDF\n\nHistorically, tools have been discovered and added by an agent to a list of available software. Overtime these lists have often become old with dead links, links to now defunct software or links to software that has continued to be developed under another name/brand/webLocation.  \n\nIn the interests of continued support for community development a means is to be defined in which the creation, collation and collection of semantic web tools can be made available using an RDF based solutions.\n\nCONSIDERATION\n\nIf a standard filetype were more easily discoverable by clients (ie: indexing sites, software seeking RDF resource, etc. etc.) then the means to better script interactivity with Sparql endpoints is amongst the possible benefits.  Other benefits include improved identification of available software/services/documents.  This in-turn results in a consideration that perhaps the underlying notion is one of updating the underlying robots.txt file to enhance search in a distributed manner for offers and web-services.  This would provide a remarkable upgrade to Web 3.0 related functionality overall.\n\nCONCEPTUAL METHOD (1)\n\nThe first mandate is to ensure community members are encouraged to provide links and references to existing services manually.  The way of doing this has been defined at the present stage to be by way of a [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19IEgvdvwl_EOGhmIFinVQu4OerRojeje8PaZWGvoO4Q/edit#gid=0) that is being developed to identify the initial scope of this undertaking and to produce the ontology needed for others to submit tools to the search solution. \n\nSTEP 1: Define ontological structure and requirements.\n\nThe development of schema will provide the means for projects to author project descriptions which can be represented using RDF via 3rd party sites and agents. To do this; the creation of a list of online tools is suggested as an approach to identify the ontological requirements for a search and update mechanism. Where schemaorg does not have appropriate references for service discovery, suggestions can be made for updating schemaorg ontology to support these frameworks.\n\nAs noted above: A [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19IEgvdvwl_EOGhmIFinVQu4OerRojeje8PaZWGvoO4Q/edit#gid=0) is being developed to identify the initial scope of this undertaking and to produce the ontology needed for others to submit tools to the search solution. \n\nSTEP 2: Map Requirements to Ontology.\n\nAn ontological tool should be developed to assist people to visually produce valid schemaorg mark-up via a web based tool.\n\nSTEP 3: Figure out tooling for production of Information about available offer. \n\nOnce the file has been created, the next step is figuring out how the owner/operator of the hosting environment can upload the information to their hosting environment and make that file easily discoverable. \n\nEnvironments include;\n\n-   GitHub (and similar)\n    \n-   Linux based servers\n    \n-   Other Servers\n    \n-   Consumer devices (inc. mobile phones)\n    \n\nSTEP 4: Figure out how to provide indexing.\n\nIf the average size of a robots.rdf file is 10Kb (noting github robots.txt file ~30Kb @1376 lines) and the total number of websites is 1.15 billion, then the total size of the file would be ~1.4 Terabytes.\n\nOnce language is taken into account, this number drops dramatically. However this is one of many facets that may be considered to reduce the total size of the file dramatically.\n\nFacets may include; Language, Type, Reputation, Location. \n\nIt is also important to note that any one services platform would likely only suit one genre of website. As such, the total indexable file-suite for any particular type of web-services provider is in-turn likely to decrease substantially again both due to the % marketPlace using the method; and, the means to discriminate based on the type of website being provided.\n\nSTEP 4: Figure out how to provide indexing. (concept 1 ipfs / “quins”? )\n\nThe theory about ‘quins’ was raised as a potential method to identify from a system point of view, which graph the quad / triple should be added to for propagation of the data into the discovery process. \n\nThis method has later been considered in-practical as it would diminish the means for a solution to grow.\n\nA decentralised method such as IPFS could provide the means to distribute standardised services tools for providing means to add the indexing file (service discovery) to something that is easily accessible. \n\nThe ledger protocol looks for appropriate files and indexes based upon the @context information.  The means of doing this is via a descriptor on the file that points to the purpose of the resource; for example,\n```\n\n{\n\n“@context” : “SparqlEndPoint” \n\n“Ipns” : “[hash]”\n\n“ServiceDecription” : “[https://w3id.org/sparqlendpoints](https://w3id.org/sparqlendpoints)”,\n\n“Reputation” : “[https://user123.reputationmanager.org/mysparqlendpoint](https://user123.reputationmanager.org/mysparqlendpoint)”,\n\n“Distribution” ; “[private]/[public]”\n\n  \n\n\"@context\": \"[http://schema.org/](http://schema.org/)”,\n\n  \"@type\": \"Encyclopedia\",\n\n  \"name\": \"DbPedia\",\n\n  “url”: “[https://dbpedia.org/sparql](https://dbpedia.org/sparql)”\n\n  \"domain\": \"dbpedia.org\",\n\n\"signature\": {\n\n    \"type\": \"LinkedDataSignature2015\",\n\n    \"created\": \"2017-02-18T08:54:19Z\",\n\n    \"creator\": \"https://depedia.com/webmaster/keys/3\",\n\n    \"domain\": depedia.org\",\n\n    \"nonce\": \"b5fb6904\",\n\n    \"signatureValue\": \"WsCvvhWFSezgAwnUi9OqJoDuXhtq+38OuU68A/NNAFIX6lEYSFSERgStOtu9MRe+6fpzFnYO7Vvp9wLLM+JlEqMa6zgiXGwjpqQ158Q0frxYVyQx0akWeomLwnvWckT4OiHuWWA7iZ96mXXlQRMDQnE3hW9PqRZpc6ZdDKsXc7g=\"\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\nIn this example, local software would identify that the distributed file = SparqlEndPoint, adding the @context information to the ledger describing the offering available at that URL.\n\nThe Reputation predicate is both decentralised and able to provide information about whether or not to trust the offer provided in the @context RDF statement.  The reputation service may identify whether the service is active, whether complaints have been made about the service or whether it's a bad actor. \n\nThe signature value (provided as an RSA example) may certify the provider account with the reputation provider and end-client with verification of their transmission to the intended end-point.\n\nONTOLOGY SELECTION\n\nThe search tool will aim to produce recommendations required for Schemaorg to provide the ontology required for the tool.  However by design any ontology tool could be used to support the method.\n\nsameAs frameworks can be used to identify other services that provide similar services based on separate ontologies.  A problem is that the ‘lookup service’ providing interface to the ledger (discovery) is not necessarily the same as the RDF service providing a description of the service.  Herein, two separate functions are considered; and whether or how these are supported is part of the question.\n\n\nUSE CASES\n-  User has mobile phone.

At which stage, the nature of the problems i'd been struggling with, without otherwise appropriate support from government officials, started to become clearer, although it took a while until i was able to talk about it with others due to governmental strategies that had been employed (and very nearly killed me).\n\nThe posts were originally posted on medium, links are often found in the posts themselves.\n\nBack around 2016, works had created a plan to create a corporate group, where the organisational structure was 'Webizen Group' but that was before the attacks escalated to a level that was very serious. \n\nIn anycase; the WebCivics works, are very much built around the premise that enterprise platforms (ie: telcos and banks) were going to engage in good faith and on fair-terms to support the growth of a knowledge banking industry; this, didn't happen.  \n\nAs such, the biggest shift with the #Webizen Approach as it is being redefined now, is that the ecosystems aren't seeking to depend upon fair-terms engagement by these large enterprises (and in-turn also government, which was critically important to that ecosystem); rather, it is forging an approach that is 'human centric' from a 'citizen centric' point of view, enabling the distribution of software and necessary services as a market-based solution - which may in-turn support a means to get to a similar sort of objective outcome.\n\nThe other thing that's somewhat distinct from the WebCivics / Trust Factory related 'knowledge banking' works to the Webizen Works, was that the knowledge banking works was very much focused on supporting a persons 'digital twin' and #AiAgent as an extension of themselves - given the infrastructure methodologies and other factors.  The Webizen approach redefines these concept to be not about a persons 'digital twin' but rather, a means to own and operate your own robot - so the webizen, isn't an extension of self; but rather, a robot or 'artificial mind' that is owned by the person who owns the webizen environment (and/or hardware) that its operating on (ie: the end-users).  \n\nPart of the insights that led to this approach were indeed inspired by the governments behaviours working in league with others to define people by their 'digital wallet' in a way, i found to be fairly disturbing. \n\nOnly recently have the [#TwitterFiles](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TwitterFiles) started to illustrate the depths of what was going on, and therein (given it kinda relates to the 'digital identity' stuff globally); the sort of thing that has been disaffecting so many.  \n\nMany of the Web Civics notes, although often draft, illustrate components in a particular way, that i hope is useful.  In particular the images / drawings on: [[Inforgs & The Collective Infosphere]] with a bit of explaination, are fairly useful, imo...\n\nFundamentally, the ecosystems designs aren't simply about the technology method; but also, the social factors involved.  The objectives are social, not simply technical; if the social objectives had been met (ie: protecting people from wrong-doing through better information management policies) then, new tech wouldn't be required.

Some new ontology work may thereby be required, with the appropriate work to define the relations with pre-existing / historical ontologies / URIs.\n\nPart of what is sought to be achieved, is to decentralise the storage of URIs on protocols that are less suceptable to dead-links via [Decentralised Ontologies](Decentralised%20Ontologies.md) efforts, which is in-turn part of the [Permissive Commons](Permissive%20Commons.md) objectives more broadly.\n\nCORE Semantic Web Ontologies include;\n- [FOAF](Existing%20Ecosystems/Semantic%20Web/Ontologies/FOAF.md)\n- [RDFS](RDFS.md)\n- [OWL](OWL.md)\n- [SOIC](SOIC.md)\n- [SKOS](SKOS.md)\n\nFacebook: https://ogp.me/\nSearch: https://schema.org/ \n\nLod Cloud: https://lod-cloud.net/\nWikiData: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\nDbPedia: https://www.dbpedia.org/\n\nPrefix.CC search for ontologies ( https://prefix.cc/ )\n\nsolid ontologies: https://solidproject.org/developers/vocabularies/well-known/common\n\nThe work on ontologies is interactive with the work on [[Permissive Commons Tech]]. \n\nThe most significant area of work that is being produced (somewhat slowly atm) is about [[Values Credentials]] which is basically about the ability to create [[Verifiable Credentials]] to support [[Safety Protocols]],  [[Community of Practice]], [[Commercial Models]] and [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]].  What this means in practice, is that the existing well known values frameworks that exist (ie: UN instruments, Professional Conduct outlines, etc.); need to be authored into a linked-data format so that they can be used with verifiable credentials, which can in-turn be employed in relation to agreements made between agents (ie: people and/or people and entities or groups). \n\nSome ontologies are no-longer available at the original location that is defined in the ontology document.  Considerations (options analysis) is underway, to figure out what to do about those sorts of cases.  In other cases, the ontology frameworks are not appropriate and/or outdated.  \n\nOntology Modelling can include processing ontologies to have inferred comprehension in relation to terms that are defined using a different ontology. \n\nThe greatest of all examples; is that in-effect, a persons life may be described as an ontology.\n\nSome resources have been provided to help people better [[Understanding Ontologies]]  from a social perspective.  Therein, the way [[Semantic Web]]  technologies work, is not simply about software agents; but moreover, about the relationships between software agents, and humanity. There are several qualities of ontological design that are important for technologists to consider when designing human-centric AI systems:  [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) offers the following considerations...  \n\n1.  Inclusivity: The ontology should be inclusive and representative of diverse perspectives and experiences. This can help to ensure that the AI system is fair and unbiased, and that it is able to effectively serve the needs of a diverse user base.\n    \n2.  Precision: The ontology should be precise and unambiguous, using clear definitions and relationships between concepts. This can help to reduce confusion and misunderstandings, and improve the accuracy of the AI system.\n    \n3.  Completeness: The ontology should be complete, covering all relevant concepts and relationships within the domain. This can help to ensure that the AI system has a thorough understanding of the domain, and is able to make informed decisions and recommendations.\n    \n4.  Flexibility: The ontology should be flexible and adaptable, allowing for changes and updates as new knowledge is acquired or the domain evolves. This can help to ensure that the AI system remains current and relevant over time.\n    \n5.  Human-centeredness: The ontology should be designed with a human-centered approach, taking into account the needs and preferences of users. This can help to make the AI system more intuitive and user-friendly.\n   \n6.  Transparency: The ontology should be transparent, clearly documenting the concepts and relationships that are being represented. This can help to ensure that the AI system is understandable and explainable, and that users can trust and have confidence in its decisions and recommendations.\n    \n7.  Interoperability: The ontology should be designed to be interoperable with other systems and standards, allowing for easy integration and communication with other systems. This can help to increase the reach and impact of the AI system, and enable it to work effectively within a broader ecosystem.\n    \n8.  Scalability: The ontology should be scalable, able to handle a large volume of data and concepts without losing performance or accuracy. This can help to ensure that the AI system can effectively serve the needs of a growing user base.\n    \n9.  Sustainability: The ontology should be designed with sustainability in mind, taking into account the long-term maintenance and evolution of the AI system. This can help to ensure that the system is able to continue to serve the needs of users over time.\n    \n\nOverall, it is important for technologists to carefully consider the qualities of ontological design when designing human-centric AI systems, as this can have a significant impact on the effectiveness and usability of the system.

The objective originally described and circulated to Ministers, Government Representatives and others; was to create a project that was designed to manifest through the lens of creating a MegaFactory (or 'gigafactory') upon a productivity target of producing 1 million dwellings; something that was not seemingly considered at all by the government at the time.  \n\nThe main barrier that was not overcome; was that i created a presentation asking my Federal Government to produce a [GovTeams](https://govteams.gov.au/) Environment to support the development of an alliance framework with multiple parties; as to provide a safe environment before that was able to be formerally established.\n\nAfter a great deal of work on this project, and indeed also - a great deal of discouraging and fairly disparaging remarks, the federal budget was announced on the 25 October 2022; and in that announcement was some minor details for a plan that sought to produce a million houses and do so through a multi-stakeholder '*accord*'.  I then sought information about how this plan came about, as to seek to clarify how it was that something new was created that looked like my work - but government was unable to respond in any honourable manner..\n\nThe introduction to my long-form document, last edited on the 27th of August; starts as follows,\n\n*I don't know how / if i'll end-up being paid which is a problem that also dis-affects people who may also do useful work, but only be able to turn that into something that economically helps them - if they take the work somewhere else, to gain a benefit rather than living with the costs.  I am working to seek to address this problem, but it is a systemically difficult problem to resolve. This issue is part of the broader problem that acts to disaffect many - leading to negative impacts in other socio-economic areas, broadly.  Whilst there are ways this problem, and many others of a moral kind - can or could be addressed - the feasibility of doing so effectively, appears to harbour enormous costs.*  \n\n*The resilience of systems that knowingly exploit others for profit - referred to as #ScumbagTech or #ScumbagEconomics - is thriving at the moment.  It harms people, but the benefits for others are significant, and the implications of addressing known problem - also significant.* \n\n*This problem is seemingly not unlike issues of past where somehow - prior forms of slavery economics were overcome.  In our modern context, whilst the moral issues remain - the dynamics have changed.*\n\n*This is very illustrative of the broader, underlying problem.  This project isn’t simply about the production of a housing system, but moreover a commercially viable method to address the issue that People involved in #ScumbagTech can get a lot of work done for free, making false claims to being able to pay invoices in future… but that these methods are unsustainable, often unwanted & wrong.* \n\n*I’ve seen a lot of that in my time, but when competitively trying to go about an approach in a manner that seeks to maintain integrity, supporting the concept of ‘#realitychecktech’ and moral equity, etc.*  \n\n*It's very difficult to get much done at all given the status of technology, what is supported & what is not.  If you have any ideas about how I might be able to find some help to stitch this thing together quickly - that would be wonderful.  Ideally something is made - properly - comprehensible, prior to budget announcements.* \n\n*This body or work isn't about simply delivering 'social housing', rather, through the use of technology the purpose of it provides an opportunity to do something else, to support the growth of ‘social equity’, via a lens that seeks to consider that concept at multiple levels - including but not solely, economically. There are means to use the derivatives to support social housing, without forming a socialist agenda.*  \n\n*In seeking to get a grasp of the underlying notion, imagine if motor vehicles were only able to be made via expensive methods; and the solution put forward to industry was to serve the needs of those without financial means via government funding that provided them an economic opportunity to operate transportation for persons who cannot afford those expensive methods. The consequence of the automotive industry mass-producing vehicles and parts for both new and second-hand availability of motor vehicle transportation, was of instrumental importance to the development of our society's ability to feature a ‘middle class’.  Whilst the complexities of the modelling i am producing to illustrate the ‘how’ is different to what would make most sense in the early 1900s (motor vehicle industry emergence), an underlying way to get a grip on the proposed ramifications is no less significant, indeed, i’d argue that there’s far greater significance that can be yielded, should the work be employed with hygiene in an appropriate way.* \n\n*From a housing perspective - the most similar sort of thing I can find are factory built ‘foldable’ homes: Some examples of these sorts of systems include [Boxabl](https://www.boxabl.com/) and [Madihome](https://madihome.com/).*\n\n*These solutions are fundamentally different to the proposed housing system i am suggesting, could be brought about, subject to appropriate levels of capital, corporate structure & moral hygiene.*\n\n>The total length of this document is 271 pages, 85,301 words and only one of the broader array of documents, presentations, corraspondance and other works involved in seeking to produce an ecosystem that was in-turn designed to [[Ending Digital Slavery]].  Sadly, it clearly didn't have the support of government policy as illustrated; and i do wonder how many houses they will require to be built for any such social housing agenda, given the implications.  Yet regardless, the broader body of the plan has; both, shifted, and in-turn also developed in a different kind of way - given the ramifications of the behaviours of others.\n\n>As may in-future be better explainable via [[Values Credentials]] and related [[Social Factors]] built into the [[PCT-Webizen Tech Stack]].\n\n### Peace Project Overview\nThe Overall goal of The Peace Infrastructure Project; is actually about rapidly producing the Biosphere & sociosphere infrstructure requirements billions of human beings across the planet need so desperately.  This would in-turn have a significant impact on our ability to deliver upon [[Sustainable Development Goals (ESG)]] and in-turn; seek to do so much more.\n\nThere are many problems that exist with the idea of producing not simply 1 million modern dwellings; but moreover - a number that is likely to be much greater than 1 billion dwellings, and an unknown amount of earth and related ecosystems that are all inter-dependent.\n\nThe ability to consider the way to achieve these sorts of massive Humanitarian Objectives; is in-turn through a complex series of future works, that in-turnemploy [[Biosphere Ontologies]] and [[Webizen 3.5]] capabilities to produce the tooling we need; to figure out how it is that we design and bring about the best possible solutions, to improve the circumstances of all members of our human family world-wide.  In-effect, the underlying objective of [[Webizen]] and in-turn tools like the [[WorkProject]] built to function related ecosystem components and/or frameworks like the [[Webizen Alliance]] is designed to create a radically scalable productivity environment; that acts as an enabler to produce solutions that improve outcomes related to informatics systems. \nIn-turn, providing a capacity to produce foundational requirements related tol both the [[Biosphere Ontologies]],  [[SocioSphere Ontologies]] and consequentially thereafter also; [[Sustainable Development Goals (ESG)]], [[Values Credentials]] and other metrics (IE: [[Energy Calcs]] ) as is then able to be considered through the purposeful deliver of solutions that act to do such things as [[Ending Digital Slavery]].\n\nIf we are unable to ensure [[Cognative Ai]] serves mankind, if the types of artificial minds that become universally promoted (see index: [[TheArtificialMindsIndex]] ) are in-fact those that prioritise support for #DigitalSlavery, #ScumbagEconomics , #ScumbagTech , if there are no alternatives that are provided the support needed to be brought about; then, there is no capacity to successfully deliver the sorts of peace infrastructure outcomes we need to advoid catastrophy.  Whilst some may not care or believe in any such sort of extostential threats; or consider that poor behaviour undertaken by them, for gainful purposes; may have far broader implications, then to some degree - there's not much that can be done about that.\n\nWhat should be possible, however, is to ensure those who think differently to those people, have a means to be provided the sorts of technological ecosystems needed, to improve the circumstances of both themselves and others; thoughout their lives, to the best of their abilities.   \n\nIndeed, those sorts of values are considered in many of the underlying instruments associated with [[The Values Project]] and it is entirely understood that not all persons are appropriatelly equipped to play any form of meaningful role, or indeed also; maintain good standing in connection with the necessary protections required to support [[Safety Protocols]] such as [[The Webizen Charter]], the frameworks that will be defined by way of [[Community of Practice]] methodologies and in-turn [[Webizen Alliance]] structures, rights, responsibilities and obligations.  Given these frameworks are all defined to support #RuleOflaw, it is hoped that there will not be any overwhelming objections raised by public officials in roles of trust and whom are in-turn obligated to support various [Values Credentials]] even though, they're only presently published in other types of electronic formats. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/Biosphere Ontologies/","title":"Biosphere Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"![Biosphere Systems from WikiPedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Biosphere_system.png)\n\nThe Work on [Biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere) Ontologies is interactive with [Currencies](Currencies.md) and in-turn also [Values Credentials](Values%20Credentials.md) and [Safety Protocols](Safety%20Protocols.md).  \n\nAll members of Humanity are part of our biosphere.  Whilst there has been a significant push towards the creation of a 'carbon economy', there are various other factors related to our means to support the development of systems that support rejuvative repercussive effects, in our biosphere.\n\nSo the concept of works in this area, is to produce ecosystem solutions that provide the option for users to make use of various kinds of biosphere ontology features and functions, to get a better grasp on their relationship with our biosphere.  \n\nThis area of work will seek to take into account various different fields of biosphere related metrix.\n\n## Energy Lifecycle\n\n['Cradle-to-grave'](https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/glossary/eea-glossary/cradle-to-grave)assessment considers impacts at each stage of a product's life-cycle, from the time natural resources are extracted from the ground and processed through each subsequent stage of manufacturing, transportation, product use, and ultimately, disposal. \n\n[Energy Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (ELCCA)](ELCCA)) is **a decision-making tool that compares owning and operating costs for energy using systems in new and remodeled facilities**. The ELCCA provides a method for the owner to evaluate different energy using systems and select the most cost-effective.\n\n## Total cost of ownership\n[**Total cost of ownership** (**TCO**)](**TCO**)) is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and [indirect costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_costs \"Indirect costs\") of a product or service.

The method considered most feasible to address this difficult balance, is emboided by the concept of creating Safety protocols.\n\nThe Safety Protocols requirement will end-up being defined in-full to be interoperable terms with by [The Webizen Charter](The%20Webizen%20Charter.md). \n\nThe Effect of developing 'safety protocols' is instrumental to providing a means to develop a decentralised social-web framework that supports values based networking between agents (people) in a way that supports the recgonition and use of declared values, to provide support for agents to provide the necessary social protections needed, to be able to create safe decentralised online environments.   \n\nTo the greatest capacity available; the intention is to make as many of the safety protocols as possible, optional.  However, the idea is that there will be notifications about whether or not another agent is running a particular type of safety protocol; as to alert others to their status or ideology, and thereby provide an ability for others they are communicating with, to decide how and/or if they want to communicate with that agent, by being able to take into account whether and/or what safety protcols they're operating.   \n\nSafety protocols may relate to providing insights as to whether or not an agent is who they claim themselves to be; or whether they've got particalar protocols taht are operated in-order to protect themselves and others from materials that are blatently criminal and/or relating to abuses of the human rights of others.  \n\nSafety protocols can be empoyed at different levels; some will be designed to operate at the systems level, others will be designed to operate in connection to the functionality of an app.\n\nSafety protocols will employ [[Values Credentials]] and [[Permissive Commons Tech]], alongside other tooling as required to make an environment that is both able to be made highly secure, and simultaniously also - support safety both for the user and others they interact with, based upon the values they decide to be important for themselves, as individuals / groups.   \n\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/Social Attack Vectors/","title":"Social Attack Vectors"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n**Topics include; but are not limited to,** \nDishonesty, Usury, Exploitation, Abuse, Malfesence, Social Harms, Deceptive & Misleading Behaviours, Wrongs, Financial Crimes, Corproate Crimes, Attacks Online, Fraud, Social Engineering, etc.\n\n*IMHO: At the end of the day, harms caused to [[Biosphere Ontologies]] entities, is fundamentally caused by other [[Biosphere Ontologies]] entities, regardless of the [[SocioSphere Ontologies]] related implications.*  \n\n*There are various forms of Social Attack Vectors, Actions and Activities; that have existed for a very long time, and others that have become a problem in recent decades due to the implications of the use of technology, as does in-turn relate to designs.* \n\nSo far, i have been able to produce some materials that cover the following sub-topics,\n\n- [[Attacks Online]]\n- [[Criminal Activity]]\n- [[Public Sector Wrong Doings]]\n\nThere is an enormous amount of work to be done in relation to this area, and it will take some time.  I also find it to be emotionally exhausting (as noted below); in the meantime, here are some of my thoughts on considerations related to this area of work that is importantly done, to an appropriate level, as to thereafter ensure solutions are illustratively equipped to demonstrate how the ecosystems are intended to work to put a stop to it and/or provide vastly improved means for accessibility to lawful remedy for disaffected persons.  \n\n\n\n#### Introduction: Purpose\n\n\n![[codeofchivalry.jpg]]\n\n\n[[The Values Project]] seeks to employ various methods, including [[Web Science]] and other [[Social Factors]] related considerations to structure methodologies to enable means for people to be better equipped to both benefit from the support of [[Safety Protocols]] and related considerations; a difficult, yet important documentation requirment is to make note of various types of 'social attack vectors', whether they're intended to be addressed via [[Trust Factory]] related methodologies or more broadly otherwise (ie; web civics, etc.) its still important that they're able to be considered somehow. \n\n> *Personally, i stuggle doing these sorts of tasks and find it very difficult to have a level of comfort about the idea that i've illustrated the problems well enough, or that it is a safe thing to undertake to do; there is both great sadness and an enormous amount of life invested into seeking to be positively responsive towards addressing problems relating to the human rights of others; and in most cases, it can't really be fully discussed publically. Yet what can be done, is that the underlying principals can be illustrated as a means to support design considerations that denote a level of responsibility that has been so clearly absent from the work done by others.  It is all well and good to solely care about 'yourself' selfishly, and not address the means to address problems - but this is neither appropriate nor responsible, nor consistant with the actual fundamental relationship between leadership and the responsibilities that are inextricably linked to the appropriate use of that term as to strive towards living in a manner that is consistant with, what may be considered a fundamental belief in the existance of universal moral values; as is something that has been referred to for consideration by [Professor Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky)... *\n> \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJ2vr2YnSGA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n>*As i have noted elsewhere, on the 3rd of April 2018 in response to corraspondance with Professor Chomsky, as i worked to pursue the development of the ontology related works required to support [[Freedom of Thought]] and related requirements.  The percieved problem was that whilst many of the [W3C CG](W3.org/community/) related folk (including those more broadly whom are involved in such things as [[Web Science]]); there was a percieved problem about the lack of social comprehensions in relation to ontological designs; as can in-turn have the effect of perverting the ability for societies to support 'common sense' and persons to have a meaningul relationship with reality. *\n\n> *Professor Chomsky noted simply;*\n\n\"The fact that there are pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility.  The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself.\"\n\n> *Yet, as has been demonstrated more significantly in recent years; there are complex underlying factors, that i have sought to address which has the effect of feeding into the [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]] designs, alongside the broader ecosystems required to support it; as, the fundamental problem becomes, that where people become disassociated as a consequence of the intended behaviours of others, then the problem becomes linked with the importance of the concept to ensure we're working on [[Ending Digital Slavery]].*\n\n> *[[Understanding Ontologies]] is of critical importance to gain a better comprehension about the implications and in-turn how they have a foundational basis in built upon science; that can and is in-turn exploited by bad actors (often highly sophistocated ones); as is one of the many forms of Social Attack Vectors that are becoming a greater problem due to AI infrastructure, that is not operating appropriate [[Safety Protocols]] - or at least, that's my opinion.  Whilst others may be satisfied and/or happy with the way their ICT systems work for them; the designs brought about via the [[PCT-Webizen Tech Stack]] and related applied methods to address [[Social Factors]] via [[Web Science]] and otherwise; in-turn leads to complex factors that fundamentally relate to human consciousness.   An example of the implications has sought to be illustrated by  [Henry Strapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stapp) in the simpliest way i've ever seen done, per below. *\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYPjXz1MVv0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n> *These sorts of considerations in-turn feed into the ecosystems design paradigms that are embedded into the body of works and the method of assembly relating to the ecosystems tooling, etc.*\n\n> *When considering the intended purpose of constituencies such as [[The Webizen Charter]], the [[Community of Practice]] and other [[Webizen Alliance]] [[Commercial Models]] that as stated - seek to support the growth of the far broader [[Peace Infrastructure Project]] , Old concepts, whether they be embedded in the systems of faith that people have in all parts of the world; or via old codes of conduct as noted earlier; and indeed also, old terms such as The term Worshipful;*\n  \n  *(a) Honorable, virtuous, of noble character, estimable; highly respectable, decent; of a knight: excelling in knightly virtues, courageous, courteous, of great prowess; maken ~, to honor (sb.); \n (b) deserving of honor or respect, praiseworthy; also, ?deserving of special treatment, singular [quot. a1500(c1477)]; \n (c) of an act, a ceremony: demonstrative of due honor or respect; \n (d) renowned, eminent, famed; \n (e) bringing honor or distinction; \n (f) as noun: one who is honorable, a respectable person. \n  Source: [Middle English Compendium](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED53455) \n\n> *Which does in-turn relate to the term [The Honourable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable) as is more commonly used today.  The underlying point being that unless there are lawful means to address wrongs that are committed upon people with the express intent of causing that person injury; or indeed also, behaviours that unwittingly or mistakenly caused a person injury; unless there are lawful means to seek remedy, then there is no available means to support Peace.*  \n\n> *As such, i find myself now having to go through the difficult process of describing the nature of some of the horrible things people seemingly seek to gainfully do; involving harms to others. Many of these sorts of issues have existed for a very long time, whilst others have only become a problem or a worse problem due to newer issues.  \n\nIt is thought that the reason why many of these issues haven't been better addressed is in-part due to the sophistocated nature of what needs to occur to bring about a more comprehensive 'ecosystems solution' to address bad behaviour / bad actors.  There are various 'classes' of bad actors which are not the same as one-another.  Often they're interactive and often it is unclear which 'category' or 'agent' is best associated with which category.  \n\nDue to various forms of vulnerability and the lack of functionality provided to support [[Values Credentials]] - that is, the ability to support a means where people self-declare what their values frameworks are; and both, what should be expected of them and in-turn also, the relationship.\n\nSo, this document and the related group of additional documents on related topics; seeks to illustrate various types of 'attack vectors' and in-turn support the means to consider how it is this environment appropriates a mechanism to provide better 'moral security' and/or alerts and accountability measures that are intended to act in-turn to better support healthy (safe) [[Relationships (Social)]], etc.\n\n#### Description of different types of attacks\n\nWhilst work to more appropriately illustrate the somewhat exhaustive nature of how various types of attack vectors are all too often gainfully employed by bad people and those who've been misled by bad people; none of it is simple, and people who have developed to become professionals in the field employ extremely well-developed and complex methodologies to achieve their objectives - which are generally for personally gainful purposes, at the material expense of others, that may well have consequences relating to serious injury, impairment, disability and/or death of their targets.  These sorts of attacks are not simple, and can often evolve in a manner that leads to many different actors getting involved in a broader 'agenda' that serves the interest (at least initially) of the would-be beneficiary.  \n\nThe consequences are often defined by law to constitute an emboidment of actions and/or behaviours that may be thereby considered an alledged crime; and whilst the proper venue to sort these sorts of things out is a court of law, the apparatus to ensure that avenue for lawful remedy be available, is often actively discouraged by an array of parties; not simply those well known to be involved in crime and/or organised crime.  \n\n\n\n\n\n### ChatGPT Contributions\n\nGiven one of the prominently employed social attack vectors is to seek to debase the merit of a persons words and/or ability to be heard or be socially supported to be listened to; the use of ChatGPT has been used fairly extensively; including contributions for this topic also\n\n\nBelow is some content that has been generated by ChatGPT.   \n\nThere are a number of social attack vectors or behaviors that can negatively impact knowledge workers who are working online. Some examples include:\n\n1.  Character assassination: Attacking someone's character online, often through spreading false or malicious information about them, can damage their reputation and credibility, and can make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n2.  Gaslighting: Manipulating someone into doubting their own perceptions or memories, often through the use of manipulation and deception, can undermine their confidence and make it more difficult for them to speak up or advocate for themselves.\n    \n3.  Bullying: Using aggressive or abusive behavior to intimidate or dominate others can create a toxic work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n4.  Exclusion: Excluding someone from important conversations or decisions, or versioning them out of documentation that they were involved in creating, can undermine their contributions and make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Harassment, including sexual harassment, can create a hostile work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n6.  Discrimination: Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic can create an unfair and hostile work environment, and can make it more difficult for people to succeed in their careers.\n\nIt is important to recognise that these social attack vectors can have serious negative impacts on knowledge workers, and can make it more difficult for them to do their jobs effectively. They can also create a toxic work environment that is harmful to the well-being of workers.\n\nTo protect against these types of social attacks, it is important to have clear policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse, and to have processes in place for addressing and resolving conflicts. It is also important to create a culture of respect and inclusion, and to encourage open and honest communication. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive work environment for knowledge workers.\n\nIf a target of social attacks is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to law enforcement, legal and/or court processes, or due to threats or fears for their safety, it is important for their employer or organization to have policies and practices in place to protect them. This may involve providing them with additional support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n\nIt may also be necessary to take steps to protect the privacy of the individual and any other persons who may be involved in the situation. This may involve limiting the dissemination of information about the situation and taking steps to ensure that any information that is shared is done so in a way that is consistent with relevant privacy laws and regulations.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation and protect the safety of the individual and any other persons who may be involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a well-defined process in place for addressing and resolving situations where an individual is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to legal or safety considerations, and to provide the necessary support and resources to ensure that the individual is protected.\n\nIf law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals involved in a situation, it may be necessary to explore other options for addressing the issue. This could involve seeking assistance from other authorities or organizations, such as human rights organizations or NGOs, that may be able to provide additional support and resources.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to pursue legal action to hold law enforcement or other authorities accountable for their failure to protect the safety of the individuals involved. This could involve filing a complaint or lawsuit seeking damages or other remedies.\n\nIt is also important to consider the safety and well-being of the individuals involved and to take steps to protect them, even if law enforcement is not able to provide the necessary protection. This may involve seeking assistance from friends, family, or other trusted sources, or seeking shelter or other forms of support to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a plan in place for addressing situations where law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals, and to have the necessary resources and support available to ensure the safety and well-being of those involved.\n\nIf a person being attacked has reported the matter to law enforcement but the situation has not yet been resolved and they are subsequently attacked online publicly and/or socially, it is important for those managing online community environments to take steps to protect their human rights. This may involve:\n\n1.  Providing support and resources: It is important to provide the person with any necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n    \n2.  Ensuring their safety: It is important to take steps to ensure the safety of the person being attacked, such as by providing them with access to shelter or other forms of support.\n    \n3.  Protecting their privacy: It is important to respect the privacy of the person being attack and to take steps to protect their personal information, especially if they are unable to publish all of the evidence relating to the matter online due to legal or safety considerations.\n    \n4.  Providing a safe and inclusive environment: It is important to create a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the online community, and to have policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse.\n    \n5.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to encourage open and honest communication and to create a culture of respect and inclusion, where people feel safe and supported in sharing their experiences and concerns.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals who are being attack online and to create a more positive and supportive online community environment.\n\nIt is important to note that in order to effectively protect the human rights of individuals who are being attacked online, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities, depending on the nature of the attack and the risks to the individual's safety. It may also be necessary to seek assistance from other organizations or individuals who have expertise in addressing online attacks and can provide additional support and resources.\n\nIt is also important to be aware of relevant laws and regulations that may apply in situations where individuals are being attack online, and to take steps to ensure that the rights of the individuals involved are being protected.\n\nOverall, it is important to take a proactive approach to addressing online attacks and to have the necessary policies and resources in place to protect the human rights of those involved. This may involve providing support and resources to individuals who are being attack, creating a safe and inclusive online community environment, and working with law enforcement and other authorities to address the situation.\n\n### Commercially Motivated Attacks\nIf the underlying purpose of an attack is commercial or related to financial crimes, and the primary purpose is to obtain an advantage and/or harm the victim in a way that will prevent them from being compensated for their work and cause them injury, it is important for communities involved in work-related activities online to take steps to protect human rights and prevent harm to individuals. This may involve:\n\n1.  Having policies in place to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse: It is important to have policies in place that clearly define what types of behavior are not acceptable and provide guidance on how to report and address incidents of financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n2.  Providing support and resources to victims: It is important to provide victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse with the necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n    \n3.  Working with law enforcement and other authorities: It may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.\n    \n4.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to create a culture of transparency and encourage open and honest communication within the community, as this can help to identify and address issues related to financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes.\n\nIn addition to the steps I listed earlier, there are a few other things that communities involved in work-related activities online can do to protect human rights and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes:\n\n1.  Educate members of the community: It is important to educate members of the community about financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to provide them with information about how to recognize and report these types of incidents.\n    \n2.  Promote ethical behavior: It is important to promote ethical behavior and to encourage community members to act with integrity and respect for the rights of others. This may involve establishing codes of conduct or ethical guidelines for community members to follow.\n    \n3.  Foster a culture of inclusivity and respect: It is important to create a culture of inclusivity and respect within the community, and to encourage open and respectful dialogue and debate. This can help to create a more positive and supportive environment and reduce the risk of harm to individuals.\n    \n4.  Monitor and address issues as they arise: It is important to regularly monitor the community for signs of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and to take prompt action to address any issues that are identified.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, communities can create a more positive and supportive environment for all members, and can help to protect the human rights of individuals who may be at risk of abuse.\n\nIf a case or circumstance like this cannot be openly discussed publicly due to privacy, legal, or safety reasons, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to those involved. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individuals involved.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of those involved. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy, legal, and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nIf a person is excluded, socially assaulted, and subjected to other broader social, mental, and economic harms as a result of an attack, and the circumstances of the attack cannot be discussed publicly due to privacy and safety issues, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to the person who has been harmed. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of social, mental, and economic abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of the person who has been harmed. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individual.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nThere are a number of compensation and other measures that could be considered in order to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit people who do the right thing and act in accordance with and support of human rights instruments. Some options may include:\n\n1.  Financial compensation: In cases where individuals have suffered financial harm as a result of being subjected to social attack vectors, it may be appropriate to provide financial compensation to help them recover from their losses.\n    \n2.  Legal remedies: In cases where the actions of others have violated the rights of individuals, it may be appropriate to seek legal remedies, such as damages or injunctions, to hold those responsible accountable for their actions and to provide compensation to the individuals who have been harmed.\n    \n3.  Counseling and support services: It may be necessary to provide counseling and other support services to individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors in order to help them cope with the emotional and mental trauma they may have experienced.\n    \n4.  Education and training: Providing education and training on human rights and ethical conduct can help to promote a culture of respect and inclusion, and can encourage individuals to act in accordance with these principles.\n    \n5.  Policies and procedures: Having clear policies and procedures in place to address social attack vectors and other forms of abuse can help to prevent harm to individuals and create a more positive and supportive community environment.\n    \n\nBy considering these and other measures, it is possible to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit those who do the right thing and act in support of human rights, rather than benefiting those who engage in social attack vectors for financial or social gain.\n\nIt is also important to have mechanisms in place for addressing and resolving conflicts that may arise within a community of practice, and for holding individuals accountable for their actions. This may involve having processes in place for reporting and investigating incidents of abuse or misconduct, and for taking disciplinary action as appropriate.\n\nIt may also be helpful to have resources available for individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors or other forms of abuse, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n\nOverall, it is important to create a culture of respect and inclusion within a community of practice, and to have policies and procedures in place to address and prevent social attack vectors and other forms of abuse. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive environment for all members of the community and to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected and protected.\n\nA semantic web ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts and relationships within a specific domain of knowledge, using a standardized vocabulary and logical rules. In the context of managing social attack vectors, an ontology could be used to represent concepts such as:\n\n-   Social attack vector: A specific type of behavior or tactic that is used to harm or

supports the critical requirements illustrated by various topics relating to [[Social Factors]] and in-particular, providing means to support the growth of [[Commercial Models]] particularly therein via the [[WorkProject]].\n\nNOTE ALSO:\n- [[Open Badges]]\n- [[Verifiable Credentials]]\n- [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]]\n- [[Permissive Commons Tech]]\n\n\n# Background\n\nI was involved in the creation of works within W3C communities that became advanced towards an outcome commonly known as ‘SSI’.  There are many areas of great concern, it is reasonable to note - I'm not very happy…   Regardless of these concerns & any merit that may exist for alternative approaches; the reality is, that these components are now globally implemented, with increasing market-pressures to deploy / employ them, world-wide. \n\nWhilst a future project might seek to accomplish a similar task using a related, yet (thought to be) distinct method;  producing infrastructure to support the needs of humanity on this ‘SSI platform’ - is likely to mitigate issues that already exist, without proper consideration; and provide a means for markets to consider the implications of ‘features’ it doesn’t easily support today.  The downside is, that there’s a probability it will also advance commercialisation; however when weighing up the factors relating to the situation, it is thought that the commercialisation is not going to slow-down, so, the best thing is to seek to temper some of the issues it has; whilst seeking to build a better pathway, if it is possible to do so overtime.   The broader problem is about ‘technology lock-ins’ being deployed, that are not necessarily good for humanity & its socio-economic moral infrastructure. \n\n# Overview\n\nThe values project is premised upon a desire to ensure people are furnished an opportunity to express terms in relation to online contracts.  This in-turn stimulates the development of a symmetrical agreement framework, rather than asymmetrical, as is the case today - as a consequence of the designs & priorities, illustrated by others at large.\n\nThere is presently no known solution to express ‘values’. There is also no good solution for humans to declare preferences with respect to the collection of information or the storage of profiling related information - such as cookies.  Whereas a relatively simple solution to address the ‘pop-ups’ that appear in websites asking for ‘cookie permissions’ would remove the need for these sorts of things, for users; The ‘values’ frameworks, is intended to provide a capacity for persons to define a set of terms that are expected to be honored; and in-turn, as a consequence of contract law - as is used by electronic services to seek rights, that any breach of contract may result in consequences / penalties / enforceable obligations.   Whilst the basic concept may be employed for purposes not intended (exploits, in-effect - as is personally felt to be the case with the broader ‘platform’ this looks to be deployed with); the purpose of this project at the present-time, is to focus on declarative instruments that are well-known and/or relating to jurisdictional laws.  In particular, the first examples will seek to deploy solutions for SDGs, Human Rights instruments and other ethics related statements of significance for international use.\n\n# Goals\n\n## Technical Goals\n\n1.  To produce a solution that provides a means for a branded images to be used to denote a corresponding values statement; in a manner that,\n    \n\ta.  supports both inspection of the terms via language (ie: english); and also,\n    \n\tb.  Machine Readable Semantics (RDF).\n    \n2.  To furnish the ability for electronic systems to be able to accept these instruments as part of the electronic contracting process; whereby,\n    \n\ta.  The  ‘values’ credentials in relation to their online contracting (“identity”) systems.\n    \n\tb.  That these terms are provided the same legal capacity as the use of other ‘identity’ related instruments used in relation to electronic contracts; and to,\n    \n\tc.  Enable signed documents that are able to be retained in a manner that is ‘tamper evident’ and consistent with the exact copy executed by the parties involved.  \n\n3.  To enable end-users to find, collect & use commonly known ‘values statements’; as a way to empower users to usefully engage with others upon a basis of mutually defined & articulated values (rights & rules) that are important to them online.\n    \n4.  The ability to manage the relationships they’ve made online with other legal entities. \n    \n5.  The ability to distribute these assets in a permissively controlled manner via DLT URIs in addition to HTTP(s) uris. \n\n\n## Social Goals\n\n6.  To illustrate & address the issues that act to hinder the useful purpose of ‘digital identity’ to serve & support the rights of persons; rather than being employed to empower rulers above & beyond rights; by forming the infrastructure needed to address how we fix it. \n    \n7.  To provide a capacity to engage in online projects with others via contract law principles on a basis of ‘shared values’; or in-effect, \n    \n\ta.  Legal tools to better manage relationships with others via electronic contracts. \n    \n\tb.  To Support rights & address issues that seek to dismantle our foundational rights.\n    \n\tc.  To improve the basis upon which we are empowered to work together in peace.\n    \n\td.  To support the ability for people to do good work for humanity - in areas, where there may be ‘dual use’ (or similar) implications, that are not sought to be endorsed or furnished meaningful assistance in any way common to intended purposes.\n    \n\n# Specifications - issues\n\nIn writing these ‘specifications’, there’s a few known issues; such as,\n\n-   The nomenclature;  Terms such as ‘wallet’ as to define a person by their ‘wallet’ is not considered desirable.  \n    \n\nThinking ATM; it's more like a persons robot app - R2-D2 or a persons ‘digital twin’ control interface & means to create, store & manage evidence.\n\n-   The differences between what is easily achieved vs. what is hoped to be achieved.  Addressing this issue features implications relating to time / resources / talent.\n    \n-   The hope / desire is to define the ‘minimum viable solution’ to then engage in further development, which is hoped to be exponential in nature overtime.\n    \n-   The broader intended ecosystem - is different to the ‘ssi’ ecosystem model; although, it is also desirable to ensure that any dominant ‘platform solutions’ be made compatible. \n    \n\n# Specifications Goals\n\nThe specification goals seek to outline what it is that the design is attempting to triage.  \n\nThere’s a few components to it.\n\n1.  The way in which the ‘[[Ontologies]]’ are handled generally.\n\ta. [[Understanding Ontologies]] provides general 'non-technical' information.  \n      \n2.  Ideally, the moral owners of the ‘[[Values Credentials]]’ would be stewards of those instruments, versions of them, etc.  \n    \n3.  Presently HTTP Uris are used for ontologies - DLT/DHT ontologies are useful; as such, the objective is to implement [[Permissive Commons]]. SeeAlso; [[Permissive Commons Tech]]\n    \n4.  [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] (including the above noted 'values credentials') are also able to be provided by providers / group entities.\n    \n3. There are presently ‘wallets’ that are defined in a particular way, which is in-turn part of a broader ecosystem that is developing.  \n    \n\ta.  I don’t like the term ‘wallet’.  \n    \n\tb. I am also not confident that the specifications of these ‘wallets’ will be ‘fit for purpose’, as such changes might need to be made. \n    \n\tc. There is a desire to store an array of digital artifacts via a ‘personal cloud’ (protected by law) solution; that will end-up having alot of ‘important (s/w files) documents’ in it.  This isn’t simply a ‘wallet’ & its not quite to the extent to which (in future) the hope is to end-up producing a capacity that might be termed an inforg.\n\n4.  The solution will require packages that are built for online platforms like wordpress.\n    \n5.  A major part of the intended purpose of these works, is to end-up with a solution that can be used for collaboratively undertaking online projects with others.  This ‘projects’ element, will in-turn require additional functionality.\n    \n6.  There is a requirement also to support ‘verifiable claims’, which may be different to what are now known as ‘verifiable credentials’.  These requirements would include the ability to define characteristics of persons required to engage in projects.\n    \n8.  The ‘values’ credentials are intended to support ‘logic’ processes that will progressively improve support for compliance tracking & relationships between credentials.\n    \n9.  A modeling requirement will be needed, in time, to support arbitration considerations where values stipulated in one of the values' credentials, has considerations that may conflict with others; as evaluated on a situation-specific basis. \n    \n10.  Seniors (in particular) have problems retaining their password / username details for websites, something that is similar to what is known as a ‘password manager’ is required. There is also ‘hearsay’ that suggests government workers in agencies relating to national security & defense, may not be properly (securely) storing their access credential information (ie: putting the information into a document that’s stored on their desktop).\n    \n11.  Designs need to consider how solutions will scale to support the needs of persons whose decisions are able to be made as a consequence of consent by a guardian.  A way to address these sorts of issues was historically attempted through the lens of a ‘pets app’. \n    \n12.  Another use-case of importance (i think) is the ability to support ‘annotations’ on content.\n    \n\n# Specifications Resources & Considerations\n\n I am advised that the US company SpruceID ( [https://github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid) ) has been doing good work. I note in particular, their libraries for a ‘did kit’ and also a ‘did wallet’ solution.  It does not appear that the ‘did’ / ‘ssi’ solution presently supports functionality otherwise produced (earlier) for the education market; whereby notes include,\n\n-   [https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html](https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html)\n    \n-   [https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/](https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/) \n\nWhereby the problem with ‘open badges’ is that they’re very much designed for education / academia; rather than an ability for people to have a similar sort of thing, relating to values.\n\nA related, desirable requirement; is to produce the tooling required to support the means for people to articulate licenses & other terms in relation to work activities online (inc. accrued rights); alongside, a means to support the ability for web-sites, to support membership and/or privacy related ‘credentials’; which would have the effect of addressing two linked issues,\n\n1.  The GDPR pop-up issue could be addressed for users of this ‘Digital Vault’’.\n    \n2.  The ‘membership’ and/or related instruments (could be group instruments / affiliations, etc.) could better support the means to address ‘micro-payments’ use-cases for content that is not otherwise publicly available. \n    \n\nMore sophisticated considerations; relating to ‘cyber security’ / sensitive projects, confidence, etc.\n\n‘[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)\n\nThere are circumstances where people will be bound to obligations (ie: employment or professional obligations) that preclude them from being able to engage on a basis that may otherwise be afforded to them;  support for considerations are important.\n\nThere is also; a significant desire for support for instruments; that may be private and/or sensitive in nature, such as clearances, vetting, police / working with children checks, etc. \n\nThis may also include a requirement to have credentials should there be problems with these sorts of ‘checks’, as may be taken into account by others when seeking to engage in fair-dealings.\n\nAlso - there should be means to address personal & humanitarian related issues; relating to mental health / illness & treatment related characteristics that should seek to better support people who are acting honestly & responsibly, rather than those who deceptively seek gainful benefits otherwise - this is in-turn, not intended to act punitively; rather, to support security.\n\nFinally; the intended ‘cyber security schema’, featured various constituent components to the overarching authentication fabric, which was in-turn an enabler for activity related factors. The effect was, to bring about an ecosystem solution - that is more appropriate for real-world security capabilities - subject to - deployment methodologies, law & operational capabilities. \n\nSome of these more complex considerations are desirable, but perhaps treated differently. \n\nNOTE:  In related work, there are various projects that will be seeking to employ these tools; whilst also, making them available for broader use.   The projects i’m particularly focused on presently are as follows;\n\n1.  An International Peace Infrastructure Project\n    \n2.  A Cyber capabilities project (domestic)\n    \n3.  A ‘community’ app & related ecosystem (for FNQ). \n\n\nWhilst the ‘initial requirements’ for each of these projects do have differences; there are also core requirements that are sought to be employed for all of them; and, as a consequence of ‘human centric designs’, it is expected that at least some people who seek to use this ‘identity solution’ will be involved in all of these projects, alongside many more.  \n\nThe expectation is that there will be an array of authentication & cyber-security technologies used to create a form of ‘informatics fabric’ that seeks to produce a hardened trustworthy environment;  this is not similar to the design of ‘SSI’ & related commercial solutions; yet, the design of the underlying technologies later used for SSI relates to the history of these tools.\n\n## Addressing the ‘social factors’;\n\nThe concept of addressing the social factors has been an on-going ‘discussion’, with little progress; and much of the progress that has been made, done in ways that weren’t ‘all good’.\n\nThere is a vital requirement to set-up a capacity for people to expressly state terms they seek to be employed in the online contracts they enter into online; and in-turn, furnish an opportunity for a market-segment of online services that support this sort of social-ideology, to grow and i believe - flourish.  There are many, many ‘projects’, or jobs / things about peace, human rights - good stuff, areas of work - that needs to be done; but it can’t reasonably be done in a manner that is built upon a propagated belief that the idea of ‘web slavery’ or ‘digital slavery’ or any form of slavery / abuse of human rights & other related values - should be considered fair or reasonable or ok in any way whatsoever - when its clearly not. \n\nThere is a change in modality that is able to be achieved - as is otherwise required - for the ‘more sophisticated use-cases’ alongside the needs of people, who seek a life - of respect, dignity & fairness unto ‘rule of law’, including a capacity to engage with civic (ie: elections) & civics (ie: peace infrastructure, or advocating for means to address social problems / issues) activities…\n\nSome of these requirements do in-turn require a means to have a safe space to store records of importance.   This is presently not very well provided for by existing solutions that now thereby define the nature of the ‘identities’ of the persons who’ve been involved & the values of their groups.  Whilst it is hoped that these sorts of exhibits will be positively influenced through the production of technology - that led to the way things are done today - to be made, to function as intended - it is also expected, that some people will always prefer alternatives for various reasons; in this way, its not unlike the circumstance of ‘freedom of religion’, whereby the concept of choice - is intended to be empowering, and not a device to force others to comply, in circumstances where the implications are knowingly unlawful & without lawful remedy by design. \n\n## The use of PNG or SVG Containers\n\nThe concept is to use PNG, SVG or other suitably defined image formats as a form of container format for [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] is a fairly old concept, that was instrumental to the [[Open Badges]] designs.  The 'image' format (particularly SVG) may be interactive / dynamic or may be static.  The Container would then also include the semantic ontology formatted to support presentation of what that asset communicates both in a human readable form and in a format that can be consumed by software agents (rdf).  \n\nIn the future there may be a better definition for a file-container method that becomes standardized as something other than an SVG; nonetheless, its thought - SVGs will do for now. \n\n## Temporal support\n\nWhilst it is desirable to start with the ‘values credentials’ that have static meanings or are represented in a manner that defines the version (noting - new version of laws emerge all the time, perhaps a qualification URI should check for any new versions as to support validity); as does, the circumstances in which the credential was used.  As such, there are a variety of time-stamps that are important to employ, as to ensure historical records remain accurate.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/Value Accounting Initiatives/","title":"Content"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n\nNOTE: This work, to collect and document a list of existing value Accounting initiatives; was undertaken in 2019 primarily by Amanda Jansen, as is noted below.

All of them contribute to collaboration in seeking to produce information systems designed to support fairness via reward systems in a decentralized way, by providing a commons friendly ways of accounting. \n\nThese solutions seek to define value flows which then can be placed in a ledger, collective intelligence system or spreadsheet for contributive accounting, open value accounting and collaborative accounting. \n\n## Aim of the document \n\nThis document aims to harvest the IT solutions found and practical tools used. It does not broadly expand to the organizational models behind them. However via the links and in the demonstrative images some of that becomes visible too.\n\nTiberius Brastaviceanu (founder Sensorica) justly said: “An organisation is a living system. One cannot just talk about an IT-infrastructure. Tools are only one aspect of an organisation, and their nature depends on the nature of the organisation.”\n\nThe underlying document is meant to demonstrate what is being developed in the p2p world until now and creates a foundation for us to create a knowledge banking methodology and organizational structure. As we hoped to be able to do accounting while we work towards this structure on the basis of this foundation, we are not sure yet that this is possible. So this is a temporary basis for which we wanted to investigate existing initiatives and practical solutions.\n\n# What are we looking for?\n\nWhat we are looking for is: existing methods of open value or contribution accounting for teams of freelancers / startups / scale ups that have been used till now. Favorably with a link to tax requirements, billing, transparent transaction, value flows and open value systems.\n\nWelcoming also analysis on the difficulties in collaborative accounting / group accounting / the shift to working in groups rather than as individuals and how this relates to present day tax systems / accounting systems and the embedding of new collaboration rules in tooling / technology.\n\nI.e. blockchain is and was promising to create something like measurable value and reputation, yet it is detached from the ordinary rules of accounting, so hard to have a one click go for billing / transaction of tokens / coins / (money). Creating economical space for renewal is wonderful, but how does it translate to the ordinary requirements? If there is an accounting system that already does that translation: from individualized work / corporate work structures to collaborative open value accounting: what were the pitfalls? Are there open ends? Are there specific learnings in that trajectory and questions to be answered still?\n\n# Solutions available in the marketplace\n\nThe below examples illustrate an array of projects that are working towards a similar goal. \n\nInstructions: please feel welcome to add other solutions in-line as a contribution (suggestion) or as a comment - for us to find and review.\n\nSolutions are of a different nature: from spreadsheets or working tools for money allocation and evaluation and management of hours and tasks / roles to blockchain solutions and open value accounting to transformative models for a new economy. Some working, some in development. \n\n### [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/)\n\nOuiShare operated before blockchain was available in spreadsheets exercising the idea of blockchain and open value accounting / having a basic income idea of spreading money over projects in ordinary spreadsheets. Prognosing the outcome of efforts and the distribution of money as well as collaboratively evaluating efforts and money streams.\n\n\nOld: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nNew:\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nBasic income try out with project budgets (50% of OuiShare’s then annual budget available for non solid issues):\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n### [Cobudget](https://cobudget.co/) (also used by Enspiral)\n\nCurrently OuiShare and Enspiral use Cobudget as a tool to manage money. Cobudget is a tool and a methodology that makes resource allocation participatory. It enables all members of an organization to get involved in decision-making by proposing projects and allocating funds to the proposals they like. What it does not do is verify if money transactions have factually been made. It does not do the accountancy either. It is a front where collaborative decisions about money can be made transparently. The factual handling of the transactions and accounting have to be done elsewhere.\n\n[https://cobudget.co/](https://cobudget.co/)\n\n ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pCktwuaYUi5c5jBDz6u0B6L9RvjxpeeKiJ7-R9srUk0ADq07PjTNs9WYTOYwaIPDDDdUV8cwq12-KYv_q8WniMr6VaO6DEAOT4CnHOfGytDSlrTukv5ZLUCJ0hGgeNzHYkq6TwI_gHPPpQG--rlNM2807D7nZLxIjzF98z0EBVeT6oGM60NpcZuSmF0g)\n\n### [Backfeed](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\nBackfeed attended the OuiShare summit in 2015 starting up a project together with OuiShare to create the first blockchain based experiment of open value accounting in which each and everyone’s needs and contributions are met with adequate rewarding out of existing budgets. An important new development was the measuring of ‘reputation’ as well as ‘value’ in the form of tokens, which led to jokes about ‘now I will lose all of my reputation’ and the like.\n\n\nUntil 2016:\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf)\n\n[http://github.com/Backfeed](http://github.com/Backfeed)\n\n\nExperiment in OuiShare in 2016:\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1](https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2](https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3](https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3)\n\n\nUpdates and articles:\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society](https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society)\n\n[http://magazine.backfeed.cc/](http://magazine.backfeed.cc/)\n\n\nGeneral notes on the meaning of blockchain and decentralization of OuiShare Fest 2016: \n\n[https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain](https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain)\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OPm49wqSN3bH6JtGsx4csyBdqYIgRenuQIB5-7bNksgh_T8_gvKplgPnCBxVlZSfu2axhqYaBwCzJ6PhpfefVyBpwzg3qNrLjt9hBdC0SWz2GDfMFzQyG0s-m1TNShCJlKu250Yc8oxv6Kg5MzyROyTOKm6oGj0LZIYSj9KRdHNTTXyeFxbu_i9N_vxW)\n\n### [Daostack](https://daostack.io/) \n\nBackfeed has been stopped as a project and went into a next initiative: Daostack.\n\n[https://daostack.io/](https://daostack.io/)\n\n[https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf](https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf)\n\n[https://github.com/daostack](https://github.com/daostack)\n\n\nRelation with Backfeed:\n\n[https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29](https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1)\n\n\nDaostack articles:\n\n[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/)\n\n[https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/](https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6)\n\n\nA synthesis of the answer provided by DAOstack’s architect Matan Field is that with Backfeed he had taken too much on himself as at some point he was effective the CEO, CTO, chief scientist, and chief product. Besides, in his words, the project lacked focus overall. Due to the many questions regarding function and design of decentralized collaborative platforms, during 18 months of work, Backfeed circled through 5 different products in search of the ultimate one that would materialize the vision and bring it into reality. Thus, it became clear that the team should stop and really specify the product it needs/wants to develop, before jumping again into further development.\n\nPayment and collaboration are currently being implemented through Genesis Alpha as a series of steps in the Alchemy project: \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/)\n\n\n“With Alchemy, hundreds, thousands, and perhaps someday, millions of people will be able to contribute to an efficient decision-making process for allocating funds.”\n\n\n“Alchemy offers a user-friendly interface from which thousands of people (or more) can coordinate towards a common purpose. Our plan to achieve this is by starting to “[Dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)” Alchemy ourselves and use it as the main interface to manage several pilots that will safely lead up to the creation of the Genesis DAO. Another path we are taking in achieving this goal is to release a set of features that will enable any group in the world to safely and easily create and manage their own DAO. We will continue to lower the adoption threshold by adding integrations with collaboration tools people are already using such as Telegram, Slack and other collaboration tools.”\n\n  \n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pv79ByTHRnFEAnLL2G-dATdxYUrk4vNgCCNlvsAPPsJaAQuYWM_Ho94HWOLPlN2IfmBEjkE4u79gdUb_oQNM02UcIvlJE1A60ej8lpXhYRphMyt3q7kWihDsq1hBZaEC7OJkAA502IQIozd7EilUR5YfHE2XwocVscL87SUWx0RE5dlk2SmLAmljtZY9)\n\n### [Foundups](https://www.foundups.com/)\n\nSince 2012 Michael Trout claims to be the actual inventor of blockchain and has been developing Open Value Frameworks with the aim to transform the broken startup world (97% of startups fail) into a foundups world in which innovation does not come to waste and ideas get recycled, rewarded and programmed into the blockchain.

To Some Degree, the only thing our existing 'Social Credit System' cares about; is how much money a person has - without so much as [[Values Credentials]] support to consider how a persons [credit rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating) is associated to what it is they do and the impact they have upon other people.  Nonetheless, there are serious threats associated with any widespread and/or governmental and/or inter-governmental systems that are universally applied upon all people as a requirement - if those systems are poorly designed and/or fail to support the basic underlying requirements, as is broadly described as [[Values Credentials]].*\n\n### Biosphere Accounting Methods\n\nAnother constituency that is sought to be achieved, although perhaps not immediately; notwithstanding the desire to build-in the capability to deploy at a future time; is the ability to support Biosphere related Accounting Methods using [[Biosphere Ontologies]].\n\nIn-Effect, there are an array of different qualities associated with the use of online services; ranging from factors relating to the creation of the hardware and connectivity used to spend time doing anything online; through to the communications and computation related costs, that in-turn relate most broadly to the consumption of energy; but also, energy lifecycles.\n\nSo, the nature of these considerations brings about future possibilities to look at how activities can be performed in a manner where users are able to make decisions about how tasks are able to be performed based upon [[Values Credentials]] preferences. \n\nThese systems may in-turn act to assist them in modifying what is presented to them and how activities are provided AI Assistance, in determining what the best way to go about doing something in particular might become. \n\nFor Example; a person may seek to be provided the best options based upon some sort of criteria.  It may be about Ethical Finance, or [[ESG]] or some other form of condition that is important to that person.   \n\nThese systems end-up having an ability to provide the capacity for people to consider the implications of their lives in a variety of different terms and high-level ontologically supported frameworks, which in-turn results in a complex [[Currencies]] environment.  \n\n### NB: Potential Roles of Web Civics & Similar Types of Entities\n\nThere are an array of [[Non-Financial Currencies]] that have some pre-existing context; meaning the ideas relating to them already exist to some extent, and whilst they may relate to 'doing good', they're not necessarily of a kind that easily supports ***exchangeability*** without some sort of assistance.  In-turn, this may provide opportunities for people to engage in doing good; and in-turn, through organisations that have social purposes, like Web Civics, others may in-turn provide [[Gifts and Donations]] that are able to be dispensed to persons whove been involved in doing works for the public good in exchange for one of the applicable non-financial currency tokens.  \n\nThe effect of these sorts of solutions might in-turn act to improve the performance of donated funds (ie; the % of funds used for direct action rather than administration of charitable organisation established to distribute funds for whatever cause); and in-turn also, decentralise the relationship between philanthropy and recipients.  This is in-turn a type of model that may provide alternatives for some who may otherwise be determined to be best served via UBI; However, \n\n1. The nature of these sorts of options shouldn't take away from the ability to support the means for people to be paid via some sort of [[Financial Payment Types]] for work.\n   \n2. There must be a good management plan that is supported by [[The Webizen Charter]] for [[Webizen Alliance]] that acts to ensure these systems are defined in an appropriate manner and in accordance with [[The Values Project]] and related [[Safety Protocols]].\n\nThere are various economic concepts; one that comes to mind is circular economy, yet there are many different concepts that exist.  It is unlikely that I will be the best expert to produce the best descriptions of the specificities of any one of these specific solutions; and broadly, the objective requirement from my point of view, is to describe the higher-level architectual considerations that relate both to the [[Social Factors]] and in-turn the requirements for the [[PCT-Webizen Tech Stack]].\n\nAs people in different fields are able to use apps made for [[Webizen 3.0]] or greater, [[Understanding Ontologies]] to produce solutions designed to work in the ecosystems; then, it is believed that there will be an array of new opportunities in this area to help [[Ending Digital Slavery]] and in-turn also, support [[Fair Work Protocols]].\n\nFundamentally, there's two main 'modalities' related to the use of online systems; people are either consuming or contributing, and whilst the distinction between the two when able to be processed at an atomic level (meaning - high-grade granularity) in a way that can associate with economic systems - the nature of the broader environment changes alot. \n\nI asked ChatGPT: What is the role of equitable distribution of currencies in supporting a healthy economic ecosystem?\n\nA:  *The equitable distribution of currencies is important for supporting a healthy economic ecosystem because it helps to ensure that economic resources are distributed fairly among different groups within a society. When economic resources are distributed equitably, it can help to reduce income inequality and promote more widespread prosperity.*\n\n*In addition, an equitable distribution of currencies can help to reduce social and economic tensions within a society, as it ensures that all members of the community have access to the resources they need to participate in the economy and lead fulfilling lives. An equitable distribution of currencies can also help to support economic growth and stability by promoting the efficient use of resources and encouraging investment in productive activities.*\n\n*Overall, the equitable distribution of currencies is an important factor in supporting a healthy and sustainable economic ecosystem, as it helps to ensure that all members of a society are able to participate fully in the economy and share in its benefits.*\n\nThen importantly also, i then asked ChatGPT: *How does the equitable distribution of financial currencies impact taxation revenue?*\n\nA: *The equitable distribution of financial currencies can impact taxation revenue in several ways. First, if there is a more equitable distribution of financial resources within a society, it can lead to a larger overall tax base, as more people are able to participate in the economy and contribute to tax revenue. This is because an equitable distribution of financial resources can help to reduce income inequality and promote more widespread prosperity, which can in turn lead to increased economic activity and higher tax revenues.*\n\n*Additionally, if the distribution of financial resources is more equitable, it can lead to a more progressive tax system, in which those with higher incomes pay a larger share of their income in taxes. This is because a more equitable distribution of financial resources can help to reduce the concentration of wealth and income at the top of the income distribution, which can in turn make it easier to implement progressive taxation policies.*\n\n*Overall, the equitable distribution of financial currencies can impact taxation revenue in a number of ways, including by increasing the overall tax base, promoting more widespread prosperity, and enabling the implementation of more progressive taxation policies.*\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/HyperMedia Containers/","title":"HyperMedia Containers"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The concept of a Hypermedia container was first considered in relation to the development of the HybridTV works in 2007-8 that related to works progressed in Europe (HbbTV) and the UK (Project Kangaroo) in particular.

Some of the considered needs are noted below, whilst this is not in any way shape or form a complex and comprehensive overview of requirements; as illustrated by this document, at this stage.\n\nA Knowledge Banking provider would conceptually store thousands if not millions of accounts. Part of the benefit of a knowledge banking industry, is the ability to provide pseudo-anonymous data-services in relation to personal data. This in-turn is assisted by decentralising discovery, through the use of decentralised ledgers, DIDs and similar. In a manner that’s very similar to DNS the practical method in-turn enables use-cases such as the ability for computer vision to be used with biometric signatures, such as facial recognition systems; where AR Head mounted displays, such as is exampled by Magic Leap or google glass; allow its user to have ‘web of data’ based apps.\n\nIn this way, the contextual environment of a person who is identified by software, can be provided the means to privately be asked what information they want to provide back to the agent (the head mounted display glasses, for instance) making a request for information. As the knowledge banking provider is not making use of a users personal and public address space, the discovery process is able to poll to identify which provider can provide information; and when the provider is identified, they can internally identify what information they want to provide back to the agent making the request.\n\nIn the context of a business conference, this might mean providing business card details. In the context of a social app, such as a dating app, this might simply be a persons first name (that might float above their head, in augmented reality space).\n\nThe second thing that’s very important is the ability to ‘churn’ between providers; or the ability to change providers. This requirement in-turn is indeed quite complex. Software Standards are instrumental to the means through which this is made possible; but the principle need for knowledge banking – account holders – to migrate their accounts (and not break the semantics, in a privacy-preserving model) requires agreements to be in-place that entitle users to be able to move providers. Semantics data-structures in a decentralised information management system, is far more complex than simply migrating funds from one financial institution to another.\n\nAdditionally; the means to ensure ‘consumers’ have an array of ontological tools that entitle them to make legal declarations by way of data, that knowledge banking providers are obligated to preserve, is also important.\n\nSome of the original considerations around this was formed in the context of [RASPS](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Jul/0043.html) or the ability to make declarations that state the data service provided by the person includes semantic information that declares information such as,\n\n- Reuse: can the information being provided be reused.\n- Accessibility: How can this data be transformed for use by the recipient.\n- Security: Is it important for the recipient of this data to encrypt it, and keep it secure.\n- Privacy: What, who and how should this data be used by the recipient.\n- Sovereignty: what ‘choice of law’ is defined in relation to the use of this data."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/digital-receipts/","title":"Digital Receipts"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 656\ntitle: 'Digital Receipts'\ndate: '2018-10-05T12:01:41+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=656'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nDigital Receipts is an area through which a vast amount of time has been delegated overtime. The material fact that industry as a whole believe thermally printed receipts, provided to customers, is the best that they can do; I find to be, offensive, and you should too. Work did need to be done on a [web-payments standards](https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/), but that’s now well and truely developed; with [lots of big companies engaged](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/73816/status).\n\nThe problem is of course; even if they were to transfer to a machine-readable receipt system, where would ‘consumers’ store their digital receipts?\n\nThe answer to that problem, is a knowledge banking industry.\n\nThere are a variety of data-models that have been available for sometime, providing the means to define a ‘machine readable digital receipt’ model. these existing tools include [ArtsXML.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Retail_Technology_Standards) The benefits of producing, storing and maintaining an achieve of digital receipts has so many beneficial uses, from the ability to manage warranty’s for product purchases, through to the ability to accounting / book-keeping benefits; and the ability to build new products, such as the means for people to donate products and services to those in need (such as homeless persons, on the street, who have specified needs).\n\nTherein; one way to explore the potential benefits is brought about by simply looking at food. The french based [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/) Lab group, have produced some work on a ‘[food dashboard](https://github.com/WebCivics/food-dashboard)‘ some years ago. Through the links provided, the means to track food from farm (or factory) to consumption, is brought about.\n\nThis information can in-turn be used to improve customer choices, about the lived welfare of animals, they consume. To look at the overall energy cost of having been provided a product; or how the treatment of it, may alter the biological benefits provided to a person. The use of food-supply chain techniques can be used clinically, to identify what foods a person should not be eating due to their own unique biological condition, which may also have environmental factors; which in seeking to track it all down, can improve immeasurably, through the use of a digital receipt system.\n\nThe benefits of local industries can be made clearer; and market forces driving improved information to consumers, can assist with the development, delivery and proliferation of new products and services that improve health and wellbeing.\n\nIn other areas; the ability to ensure manufacturing practices are environmentally friendly; The ability to ensure solar panel purchases, take into consideration the means through which the [toxic waste products](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/05/23/if-solar-panels-are-so-clean-why-do-they-produce-so-much-toxic-waste/#22909f7a121c) are processed as a constituent of the overall environmental benefit of the product.\n\nDigital receipts offer an array of remarkable benefits. Amongst all of this, is also the means to translate value to brand equity.\n\nThe ability to improve services surrounding the delivery of ‘digital receipts’ implicitly also supports a social-graph capability that provides support for ‘loyalty relationship’ management. If a consumer (customer) wants to share and engage; they can, its all baked into the way digital receipts can work.\n\nNew economic models can emerge through [DID’s and Ledgers](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/dids-and-multisig/), as was noted about tracking coffee-cups; and in this new age of ‘open banking’, the means for financial institutions to improve their service offerings and differentiate themselves from their competitors may well come down to the semantic infrstructure they build, for industry specific requirements.\n\nWhether it be ensuring customers are returning clothes less often, or building a new clothing manufacturing industry based off the back of [measurements](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/measurements-app/)\n\nThe problem that’s been holding it all up, is the ability to store this valuable, personal and private information somewhere secure, like a knowledge banking industry."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/fake-news-considerations/","title":"Fake News: Considerations → Principles → The Institution of Socio & Economic Values"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 609\ntitle: 'Fake News: Considerations → Principles → The Institution of Socio & Economic Values'\ndate: '2018-10-04T11:23:37+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=609'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUhpK-wtldA?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nAs I first published in [‘design solutions for fake news’ google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPghC4ra6QLhaHhW8QvPJRMKGEXT7KaZtG_7s5-UQrw/).\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Perspective by Eben Moglen</span>* *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from re:publica 2012 is otherwise considered with respect to the implications upon [freedom of thought](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/executive-summary/preserving-the-freedom-to-think/).</span>*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem of ‘fake news’ may be solved in many ways.

Linked-Data powers many of the online experiences we use today, with a vast array of the web made available in these machine-readable formats. The scope of linked-data use, even within the public sphere, is rather [enormous](http://lod-cloud.net/)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, most websites are using ‘linked data’ to ensure their news is being presented correctly on [Facebook](http://ogp.me/#)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and via search, which is primarily supported via </span>[<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schema.org</span>](https://schema.org/docs/about.html) <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n**The first problem is:**<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that these ontologies do not support concepts such as [genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This means in-turn that rather than ‘news’ becoming [classified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genres)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as it would in any ordinary library or newspaper, the way in which ‘news’ is presented in a machine-readable format is particularly narrow and without (machine readable) context. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means, in-turn, that the ability for content publishers to self-identify whether their article is an ‘advertorial’, ‘factual’, ‘satire’, ‘entertainment’ or other form of creative work – is not currently available in a machine-readable context. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is kind of similar to the lack of ‘emotions’ provided by ‘social network silos’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to understand ‘sentiment analysis’ (EG: research links [1](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/berrin/share/LDA/Stanford-NLP-Course-termproject-ssoriajr-kanej.pdf) and [2](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jennifer/2016/06/28/sentiment-analysis-on-social-network-data-twitter-facebook-etc/)) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through semantic tooling that offer means to profile environments</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and offer tooling for organisations.

Whether it is the means to “fact check” words, ensure images have not been ‘photoshopped</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ or other ‘verification tasks’, one or more reputable sources could use verifiable claims to in-turn support end-user (reader / human) to gain confidence in what has been published.

By uploading the information and having it stored online in a secure account all a user has to do to is click a button to scan a tag or authorise an online website to access the measurements information, which will then automatically allow the website or via the mobile app – notify the user about whether or not the item will fit the customer or intended recipient of the purchase.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The application makes it easier and more convenient and time efficient for customers and retailers alike through this innovative way of assisting people in making purchases via online retailers and traditional stores.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The information produced by the measurements app is also shareable with others on a permissions basis. The ability for someone to share their measurements enables others to shop on behalf of the user, without being worried about whether or not purchases will fit. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customers for the application are retailers who purchase a subscription from the site. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Application helps retailers convert their design-sizes and any material related aspects (such as shrinkage, etc.) into a format that is easily converted between one measurement system to another digitally. Premium versions of the application will also provide anonymised information about the user-base. This in-turn helps designers produce stock quantities suitable for the market through qualitative information made available.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is considered that the Measurements app will have health and safety benefits for consumers, as small things such as uncomfortable underwear or shoes that do not fit properly can result in long-term health problems and helmets that may result in future damage in the case of an accident.. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also considered that the measurement app will assist retailers in many ways, including but not exclusive to aiding others purchase clothing as a gift, enhancing loyalty relationships, improved customer experience with less need for trying clothing on prior to purchase; and improved confidence about purchasing items online. additional benefits include the capacity for the application to support the development of new industries as the measurements of individuals is already done for members, which means the capacity for individuals to order custom clothing becomes that much easier.</span>\n\n**USER EXPERIENCE – concepts**\n\n**Consumers**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A user is expected to either obtain a measuring tape to measure themselves or to obtain the services of someone else to measure them. The application can accept measurements in various forms from millimeter to centimeter to inches and other units, automatically converting these units online to suit different merchandising measurement systems.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Measurements application will be available both on mobile and for desktop computers. An interactive guide will help people take their measurements, help them easily and privately share their measurements information and remind the user when they measurements haven’t been done for a while and may have changed. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The application will show the user both when they last measured themselves; as well as what measurements they’ve completed and what measurements they’re yet to do.. </span>\n\n**Retailers – Online**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online retailers will be provided with an array of tools including an API specification, plugins for major content management systems platforms and online tools to help them understand how often the application is being used in addition to being able to provide loyalty discounts to members who use the application and provide approval to the retailer for marketing purposes. </span>\n\n**Retailers – Stores and Manufacturers**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stores and Manufacturers will be provided a set of tools that helps their products easily interact with the measurement app to obtain sizing information and make recommendations to consumers about which products fit best, and whether the sizing is optimal, suitable or unsuitable for that consumer.</span>\n\n**VAR – Industry Solutions**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our solution uses W3C Credentialing Technology alongside 2D barcodes that can be generated online through our API and related software products. We’re actively looking for partners who are interested in integrating with our technology to help their customers provide consumers the best possible retailing experience. </span>\n\n**Complexity of Measurements.**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst shopping for apparel may seem relatively simple, many will be surprised to know that it is actually quite complicated when it comes to obtaining all the right measurements for a person; in addition to translating that the various sizing and styling available in the marketplace. each area of the body has an array of different measurements that relate to whether clothes fit, whether they fit well or whether they’re unsuitable. </span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/preserving-the-freedom-to-think/","title":"Preserving The Freedom to Think"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 627\ntitle: 'Preserving The Freedom to Think'\ndate: '2018-10-04T13:46:47+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=627'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Our socioeconomic frameworks and the means preserve the ‘freedom to think’, or ‘freedom of thought’, is influenced by ‘artificial intelligence’ systems. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It is influenced in ways that range from issues illustrated by ‘autocorrect’, through to the economically derived methodologies through which information is preferentially presented to us, or ‘hyper personalisation’. It is also influenced both by what we choose to expressly provide, and what we do not provide information about. Whether it be the nature of interpersonal love shared between two people; or the many other, deeply personal attributes, AI is both shaped by us and what it knows (or does not know) about us; to in-turn, be employed by systems that shape us. </span>\n\nIt is increasingly through out ICT systems that a ‘selection’ of materials are produced; often, in relation to some set of specified purpose.\n\nIn-turn, this often subjectively produced selection of ‘data points’ are brought about, in relation to the author of those works (and/or their relations) alongside the influences of linguistics &amp; circumstances, in which any such material was made able to be produced and the information and knowledge relied upon for its production; as is a poor description of a knowledge graph.\n\nThe use of technological tools is becoming increasingly instrumental. There are qualitative differences between different types of tools that are made available; and, the functional properties built into them.\n\nThe ability to discern fact from fiction increasingly relates to the information sources relied upon to form an opinion; alongside the revenue model employed in relation to those sources, where some sources can in many cases be made known to be less than accurate, some subjective, alongside others that may be too complex and/or specialised.\n\nThe means through which we ‘think’, is for the most-part built upon our ‘learned’ or ‘lived experiences’.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nWhere we are made to consume information that is entirely unreliable, as apposed to nature; our view of the world (or of any particular subject) becomes distorted. Our freedom to think, becomes taxed. This is a core constituent to the operating economic models exploited online and the effects of it are not easily contained. Part of the drivers are described by [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) concepts; whilst thats only a small part of it.\n\nSemantics in the real world are dynamic and both entity and temporally unique. Our information systems do not support the nuances brought about by the exchange between online socioeconomics, and our natural world.\n\nThe trend of how data influences our world is increasing as the proliferation of internet connected devices, and the use of information management systems, increasingly relates to our environments. These systems are currently operated in a manner that is designed to most benefit the provider of ‘things’.\n\nThis can have implications on what should be said near them, even in private, and what should be expected of them; as the ‘operators’ are most-often influenced by commercial opportunity and lawful requirements put upon them; as does relate to them, as a corporate legal entity from somewhere in the world.\n\nBefore these changes, before[ pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/), the means to impart knowledge as to communicate knowledge between people was freely able to be done, without significant cost in most circumstances. A childs parents did not need to pay anyone to teach their children about plants, animals, places and knowledge relating to being human, to living in our world and being able to best make use of it.\n\nThis was most-certainly improved through books, schooling and other resources; but not quite in the same way that now impacts all of us, in our internet connected world.\n\nThe means to retain and enhance our ‘freedom to think’, requires our society to think about how it is we want to deploy ICT. It needs ‘fit for purpose’ tooling that’s been design in such a way, that holds *values* to the core of its designs.\n\nDo we want a world, where we are better able to serve the needs of our loved-ones by restricting the knowledge we impart to others as to help them, as is now the case with all too many employment contracts today. do<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> we want those, we depend upon, to be bound to contractual agreements for gainful employment as lawyers, public service workers, medical clinicians, law-enforcement officers or otherwise; that restrict their freedom to think.</span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">or do we need to build something else, that can preserve freedom, to think.</span>\n\nDo we want to build economic frameworks that places unnecessary burdens upon humans, as to be entitled to exist? or,\n\nCan we extend human rights, modernise the theory, and ensure its employed, deployed and made available to all those whose **lives** are *linked* **online**.\n\nIn 2012, [Eben Moglen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen) presented a talk about the problems as he considered them at the time. Where Moglen speaks of a ‘giant global graph’, he is talking about the use of *linked*-data in relation to the means through which it was being used in 2012; which has continued to radically develop since his talk.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sKOk4Y4inVY?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe applied methodology for using these technologies were never, the only option; whilst it is still the case today, that a knowledge banking industry, does not exist, the considerations made in its design put the concept of ensuring the means for ‘self determination’ is kept ‘front and centre’ as to provide a means whereby the ontological definitions of self; is produced, by self. The devices that are connected to our environments, are controlled by us; not them, by default. It changes the economic models to eradicate the problem that there is still currently no available alternative in the market-sphere.\n\nThe means through which an inforg may be used to personalise the interactions between a person and every other agent (via ‘AI’); provides a means to support the needs of human beings to preserve (and enhance) their right to [self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination).\n\nWhilst our society does certainly have still, many choices, some of those choices are considered to offer better outcomes. A conversation debating these issues was brought about in 2017 through my work; which included, in preparation, producing this (relatively short) clip.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9vROTibKiE?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe issues that is becoming increasingly clear, present; and in desperate need of an immediate response, have developed over sometime, its now more than 20 years old. The introduction of ‘online data storage’ to consumers was the commencement of a set of globally applied social decisions made by the few.\n\nToday, consequentially; It is not so much a computer-science based technical problem; any more than work on other areas is, for instance, the means for a group of people to design and build a new house; the tools and resources exist to do it, but its not done; until its been done.\n\nA knowledge banking industry; is considered by me, to be the best way to solve the problem. Indeed, *all things sound good in theory*, yet, the means to ensure something like an knowledge fiduciary, as an extension of our role as citizens through which our representatives make laws on behalf of us, to keep us safe. It is indeed through the application of new tooling that is brought about by a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that civilian engagement in systems of democracy can be radically enhanced.\n\nThe tooling required to ensure our ability to work cooperatively, can bring about new and improved democratic practices; that can be built into our ICT infrastructure as to make use of the same data systems, to form radically different systems than those depended upon today.\n\nDoing, building a decentralised model as is required to address the broader issues; in-turn, provide far better means, to preserve our needs, our freedom to think.\n\nThe use of Artificial intelligence can be used in many, many ways and reality ***does not necessarily need to be presented,*** to you in any way. The hope is,\n\nthat the tools for you to make decisions about what you do with it, are not simply maintained by you; but moreover, built as instrumental parts of our future, as independent persons who live in a natural world made to be the priority over all other things. That STEAM continues to be made most important; and that our freedom to think, freedom of thought, is not sold.\n\n> STEAM = science, technology, engineering ART and mathematics.

I illustrate my frustrations, i illustrate the environment where solutions exist, noting, it is logically impossible to disassociate a persons consciousness from their ability to communicate and explore concepts of the world around them.\n\nFor any person to form a view and to communicate that view as to be understood by others, depends upon an array of functional properties that are applied to computing systems, using math and physics.\n\nSocial informatics systems interfere with the means for persons to communicate. Most of the time, this is considered in terms of the benefits.\n\n> World was a much smaller place before the advent of the telephone.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The practice of forming communications events requires each human entity participating to be conscious, to have, what we call, </span>consciousness<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">. </span>\n\n> something that’s existed long before the telephone.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The application of social informatics design principles attends to the relational interference patterns that emerge both personally, and socially, as a result of informatics design as applied to ICT.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">An intended distinction is made between a ‘human centric’ approach as an alternative to the others that are operating today. The purpose of a human centric approach focuses upon the material impact (“interference pattern” relating to human consciousness) as is experienced by humans; whereby the informatics design principles centres upon the needs of humans, as the natural world stakeholders actively involved in the system, rather than any other alternative. In-order for this field of design principles to be made ‘fit for purpose’, it does indeed depend upon the proper use of it, in the real world.</span>\n\n### Web 2.0 vs. a Human Centric Informatics model\n\nInformatics modelling is known to exhibit ‘interference patterns’ that lead to effect on the natural world. Web 2.0 informatics models are known to have an array of significant short-comings, Irrespective of the (short-term) gains made by the artificial actors involved in the informatics systems processing model platforms; the means to describe considerations involved in remodelling informatics systems to be ‘human centric’ is complex and multifaceted.\n\nTo address the modal requirements involved, an array of different fields of study is conversantly required to be brought together.\n\nThis is achieved through conditioned responses (somewhat referred to as ‘[classical conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning)‘) as has factually related to lived experience, ‘intelligence’; and as a constituent of considerations therein,\n\n> the developmental comprehension of languages.\n\nIt is presently the case that the convergence of language or linguistic use does not always provide the same meaning between languages. Whilst there are easy examples,\n\n[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-07-at-2.31.15-pm-1024x247.png)\n[link](https://translate.google.com/#en/id/water) \n \nthe greater problems emerge when complex concepts are provided shorthand notation that do in-turn take quite some time to translate and support the growth of comprehension to the recipient; which is in-turn an experience that forms a body of experiences to the person imparting the knowledge.\n\nWhilst our networked computing systems of today are far more “intelligent” than humans in this way; as is demonstrated by typing any question into google, which will rapidly draw a world of knowledge in a way that is impossible for any human agent to do; the emergence of these social machines in a web 2.0 construct is indeed causing problems.\n\n![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/22426309_1963344347247232_6591348862593366590_o-1-3-768x1024.jpg)\n[The book Social Machines can be found in the [books]](https://www.webizen.net.au/resource-library/book-library/) section of the resources library provided by this site.\n\n#### Interpretational modality\n\nUniversally, the design requirement to include considerations about how persons communicate their views, as related to the use of languages and the conditioned behavioural responses formed as a constituent of the apparatus that forms consciousness; needs to be applied by professionals both;\n\na. the means through which their thoughts about *how it is,* their modality of consciousness works; and,\n\nb. the means they elect to employ any modality, to communicate (to others) at any given time.\n\nThis in-turn illustrates in a somewhat plain way, the means through which persons are made able to create their own interference patterns, as to make use of the freedom of choice they have biologically, as is concussively disaffected by poor informatics systems design and any social reliance systems build upon the failings of these systems.\n\nA nuance therein, is that the discussion about *the implications their discoveries,* and *their own means to find understanding of themselves* is in-turn inextricably linked to *their own form of consciousness*.\n\nThe repercussive effect of *parallel conversations*, about how their works has applied to them and how the product of their work, can be applied to other ‘things’.\n\nSeemingly, in-turn, considerations in different ways, are made by the interpretations by experts; who are known as to have served humanity, and an array of eloquent nuances that are difficult for social machines to non-declaratively comprehend. This intricate relationship produced by humans, in communications that form bridges between the social-sciences, math, physics &amp; information sciences; becomes a core field of emergent human expertise, as an emergent field of specialisation, instrumental for society.\n\nThe field itself, speaks to the role of ethics in the development of medium. This is not unlike the realm of ethics sought to be depended upon by others in fields of significant social reliance, whether it be the job of a person carrying out their field of expertise as a judge, law enforcement officer, doctor, engineer or technologist; there is an innate sense of ‘social contract’, that our current ICT systems as have forged our Web 2.0 environment have not met.\n\n### Informatics Design 101\n\n> now therefore; here’s a quick intro…\n\n[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-1.26.19-pm-1024x641.png)](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/screen-shot-2018-10-05-at-1-26-19-pm/)\n\n> *Informatics* is a branch of information engineering. It involves the practice of information processing and the engineering of information systems, and as an academic field it is an applied form of information science. source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics)\n\nThese works aim to confer the means to consider various forms of information systems embodiments, for our socially connected, prosthetic extension of persons via ICT. This is perhaps the most convoluted summary of complex concepts that i still feel an attempt to parse, is worthwhile.\n\n#### The Emergence of Naturalised Interfaces &amp; the prosthetic ICT realm\n\nTechnology is rapidly evolving and considerations now need to include the influences Web of Things (or Internet of Things) will bring about, alongside other technological influences such as Augmented Reality Head Mounted display technologies (such as magic leap) where the vision of the future, is often considered in dystopian terms…\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/166807261?color=c9ff23\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n[HYPER-REALITY](https://vimeo.com/166807261) from [Keiichi Matsuda](https://vimeo.com/chocobaby)\n\n#### Social systems informatics design\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The knowledge banking industry approach seeks to augment the way information systems work, at a rudimentary level. As highlighted throughout this site, It seeks to achieve this by way of a decentralised system of [inforgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg); in which the use of ontological forms, or semantic sentences, forms a frameworks of tools to form a temporally notated knowledge-sphere, of personal agency; capable of recording the interference causality of interactions between self, artificial and social agents may furnish improved agency of self.</span>\n\n> [\\#Language](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Language?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) &amp; sentences are old concepts.

This in-turn made-up part of what are known elements of a [liberal arts education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education).\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Hortus_Deliciarum%2C_Die_Philosophie_mit_den_sieben_freien_K%C3%BCnsten.JPG)\n\n[Herrad of Landsberg Public domain](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hortus_Deliciarum,_Die_Philosophie_mit_den_sieben_freien_K%C3%BCnsten.JPG), via Wikimedia Commons Whilst this has been a field of study, as it does linguistically form relationships in the natural world, for sometime, the means to inform its intended rationale when appended to what is currently employed by ICT in our modern environment is different.\n\n- [Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology)) sameAs/similarTo [FOAF Agent](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent)\n- [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood) sameAs/similarTo [Legal Person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)\n- [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy)) sameAs/similarTo [digital identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity)\n- [Metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) sameAs/similarTo [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)\n\nThe modelling of linguistic reuse, as is currently observably normalised by information management systems designs today; are engendering causal impact through both intentional and unintentional design effects. Implicitly, the distortions that are caused as a result of these issues, are in-turn put upon natural persons in a manner that becomes part of an interference pattern.\n\nIn computer science terms, this is called a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) and is more-often used in a plural agent form, as an engineered temporal [social graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph).\n\n[![](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/light/u12l3a1.gif)\n\n[interference pattern](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/light/Lesson-3/Anatomy-of-a-Two-Point-Source-Interference-Pattern) \nThe concept of an interference pattern as may be made use of by computer algorithms can be considered in relation to the application of the same form of scientific expression in relation to light. Whereby in a ‘social graph’ the interaction between two agents does in-turn cause an interference pattern, although involving far more than simply two agents at any stage in time; over a temporally relevent period, as is otherwise consistent with the animated display of the wave demonstration.\n\n#### Web 2.0 Economics – The Attention Economy\n\nAs is brought about by applied science, these informatics models are most readily applied in a manner that is designed to sell advertising, whilst not exclusively the case. Therein, the informatics design methodology is set-up to exploit the liberal arts to drive an [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) to enhance engagement. Engagement, in current advertising models, drives revenue, which builds sites.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/50R21mblLb0?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe psychological effect brings about circumstances through which it intentionally causes an absence of rational relations, of otherwise by medium, accessibility and mutual recognition of intended views, between the distinct spheres, or unified rational points of view, constituting the distinct persons or identities, involved at each end-point of an end-to-end communications event. Whilst technology circumstances renders a means to maintain responsibility, this has in-turn been made by operators, to have been made mute.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNsbKtckzcM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nBuilding upon these pre-existing structures is making matters worse and there is no technical (meaning ICT) reason, why the organisations building these platforms have not been able to build alternative solutions (such as a knowledge banking industry) that would address the issues. \n\nThe ramifications for how software ‘web-native’ ‘active agents’ now build upon these systems, leveraging ‘machine learning’ / ‘artificial intelligence’ technologies; to apply concepts in formula, to ‘win the game’; as they are programmed to do by persons working for the organisations that define them.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ewj4ql6pu9w?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nArtificial Intelligence is in-effect the creation of an ‘active artificial agent’ or ‘web native’ person; controlled by the formerly most powerful artificial agents, corporations, who did not had the capacity to act without a human expressly acting on behalf of it. ‘web natives’ are different, geared for generating profitability for the corporations who operate them, they influence reality.\n\nThis is new and as influential as any other former tool used for mass effect. It was formally the case that issues pertaining to the actions performed by natural persons, on behalf of companies, could lead to prosecuting the specific humans as responsible parties; the same is not the case for AI agents.\n\n#### A Defined rationale for a new and different informatics structures.\n\nBy modifying the modal structure in which all artificial actors are designed to act; as to bind the responsibility of acts to human actors, as is achieved in a human centric web; the foundation of having a defined environment whereby the definition of an ‘artificial actor’ is fundamentally changed. \n\n> The dynamic responses of an artificial agent is defined, prosthetically, by way of an inforg, by a human person. Whilst information structures are socially exchange; the AI agent facilitating these exchanges are all different, unique.\n\nIn-so-doing; the means to serve the needs of our natural world and nominated natural actors who are responsible for them (akin to children or companies via directorships) becomes more reasonably possible. The nuances of these relationships can be define, refined and provided real-world support in ways that web 2.0 based solutions have been found simply incapable of doing.\n\n##### Why making a Human Centric infosphere is so important\n\nImagine if the info-sphere was inextricably and pervasively bound to the temporal and intrinsically granulated; delegate authority, of human actors – whom collectively maintain the authoritative custodianship of our ever more complex natural world. Imagine the difference is systems were designed to represent human persons, rather than the otherwise, overly simplified economic valuation models suggested to be in the interests of corporations.\n\n> *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even a government is made incapable of forming means to comprehend their own irrelevance, where informatics circumstances render the personhood of its members, to be made, mute.</span>*\n\nAny group of natural persons, including those who make-up the operating institutional framework of government; whose role it is to work on behalf of the people, is in-turn made-up of people, whose views are subjectively engendered upon the basis of the information they rely upon, to do their jobs. Through the unreasonably narrowed form of informatics use, in an otherwise pervasively applied informatics environment, systemic implications brought about by ‘fake news’ and the difficulties natural persons have in providing evidence of facts, otherwise stored in online systems, acts in concert to undermine personhood. If we do not maintain the beneficial ownership of our personhood; we do not have the means to do good in any role, for any group. \n\nI considered, a long-ago, this to be some form of “conjoint, metaphysical neurosis”, as our socioeconomic systems sought to preserve a meaningful ‘sense’ of being, and of purpose; through which, the temporally faceted qualities of having been observed, as an observer; was thought by me, to require a different ‘information management systems’ design framework.\n\nOvertime i’ve found the concerns identified so many years ago, to be shared.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcuzNfPA584?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n#### Challenges that need to be overcome\n\nOvertime, irrespective of our need to form a ‘human centric web’, the opposite has occurred. There are multiple embodiments of how to form of methodological use of ontology, semantics and the nature through which the intended input of humans is interfered with by artificial agents, for programmatically defined purposes, on a medium that is dynamically evolving ‘autonomous’ machines and artificial super intelligence. The lens through which this is now done relates specifically, to economics. Many believe ‘bitcoin’ will be the solution, but i think they’re missing the point.\n\n[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/all-the-worlds-money-infographic.png)]  \n[All the worlds money in one visualisation by Visual Capitalist 2017](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/) Our means of societal governance has made the use of computing systems inexorably tied to our means of maintaining personal safety, social security and socio-economic participation.  In a cashless society, where food is made available through the use of computing systems; in environments of significant population density dependently operated by systems controlled by computers; forging social communities of humans, who are increasingly unable to communicate or seek assistance of others they know, without computers; the sustainability of our natural world is being defined through the use of ICT.  Therein, whilst there is an emergent discussion about ‘augmented reality’ in the context of new ‘head mounted displays’, in reality, our lives, our societies, our realities – have already *augmented* by ICT.\n\n#### The (un)intentional Augmentation of Truth: ICT intepretation of natural justice.\n\n> In [English law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_law \"English law\"), [Natural Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_justice), **natural justice** is technical terminology for the rule against bias and the right to a fair hearing. This must be coupled with [Evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence), broadly construed, is anything presented in support of an assertion, as it is the case In law, that rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a legal proceeding. Where natural persons do not have the beneficial use of the storage medium in which evidence is stored, natural justice is made to be incapacitated; and is now-therefore, poorer for it.\n\n##### Data Quality\n\nIf an employee of a company looks you up in their database and it says something about you that is inconsistent with your statements; who do they believe? does it need to be correct, complete or shared with you?\n\nno. it does not. Law as is applied to the development and use of informatics systems have not been designed to support those natural justice related requirements. The systems in-place are for use by employees ([agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency)) who are sought to make decisions about you through the use of the systems designed for them to use, for the benefit of the [legal personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) who provides the employee income. This in-turn can lead to data-errors that range from false-statements, mistakes, misrepresentations and worse. As the data-systems are not designed to immediately and by default provide both participants an electronic copy of the materials relied upon by the fiduciary, distortions become an effect of informatics systems design.\n\n###### Considerations, of an agent\n\nAs we have successfully forged a pervasive augmented concepts of corpus over a very short period of time, whilst failing to understand how to serve the underlying purpose and meaning of the word that was defined to be meaningful way back in roman times. Yet smart-phones are only a little over a decade old; technology has moved so rapidly, when society needs more time.\n\nWe have now, consequentially, put in-control derivatives of these *ancient concepts* [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History) as the community through the *[lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(philosophy))* of [*persona ficta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)’ preserve on our behalf, our needs in our natural world.\n\nWe have built an incredibly capable [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), yet it has been made to [usurp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usurper), ‘wisdom of man’, or ‘[wise man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens)‘, as to engender collectively subservient in exchange for ensuring they are not reasonable subject to penalties for failures, in any way that may provide adequate remedy to the disaffected. \n\n> Most of the most successful Web 2.0 businesses were built by first breaking the law, building an enormous international business; and then working with law-makers to make, their business models, legal.\n\nWhilst it is certainly the case that the former industrial era controls are a poor-fit to our modern society; the result brought about by our engineered solutions for information systems as has been implemented by design, as are now constituents of our socioeconomic, architectural features; exhaustively illustrates contextually; as a ‘common-service method’ for societal operations infrastructure (world-wide), whilst threaten all life with inexorable risks. \n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are choices that have been made; they are not innate flaws of ICT as a form of technology, that can be used to resolved the architectural challenges, should the choice to do so be made.</span>\n\nThe problem that any solution depends upon today; is in its means to illustrate the reason why solving that ‘particular’ problem, is so very important.Certainly building entirely new systems needs to be justified in serious terms. \n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means in which to form an information management structure that is centred upon humans, rather than companies, making the human actor personally responsible for their choices is a fairly radical idea.</span>\n\n#### Engineering Informatics support for Personhood\n\nTo form a means of comprehending the nature of how perceived reality is formed; is considered often, to be contrary to the interests of existing stakeholders, to make information available to ‘them’ (most often meaning, consumers). \n\n> Yet upon what basis do they form an understanding of why decisions were made; and what it is that can, or should, be done to make the necessary adjustments.\n\nThe changes that are seemingly required, i conceptualised as a new form of information and knowledge management system, that makes use of a ‘human centric’ approach, as is defined by present technologies. The purpose being, to build an informatics system that is guided by an interference pattern caused by individual human actors purposeful decision making practices; as the primitive constituent, of any other formative derivatives that may therefore ‘be evaluated’ (re: [inferencing](https://www.webizen.net.au/inferencing-introduction/)) as to form a record of comprehension; and its relations to patterns of diffusion and cognitive dissidence, as is made presentably measurable overtime. \n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way the information system develops a means in which to forge a comprehension of the intent, as is stored as part of a graph. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Overtime, this is consumed by agents to process and </span>evaluate characteristics.\n\nThe resolution of available data-points for operational data-metrics is continuously developing in resolution; as it does, the means to evaluate vectors of ‘communicable error rates’, are increasingly made able to be mapped (and/or manipulated) overtime. Machine evaluation of ‘lineage of acts’, carried out between the ‘junctures of intended purpose’ and ‘applied evidentiary outcomes’, improves the means to act in anyway. By bringing to market a knowledge banking industry based on supporting individuals, the means to ensure these business processes are efficient, is bought about.\n\nPut simply, it is currently the case that one group of actors (legal personalities) have a bunch of data, another group (natural persons) don’t.\n\n> Decisions that need to be made by responsible persons, needs reliable data.\n\nDecisions to address issues that affect humans, are far more difficult than resolving issues that affect legal personalities; due simply, to the information management systems design framework used, and maintained. There is a substantive [competitive advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage) brought about by solving this issue.\n\nTherein, considerations of how these [modals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic) may be consistent with the means of artificium notation; through the use of creative works such as [Sophomore’s dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore%27s_dream) may in-turn provide a means to form the interpretative values for artificial actors with improved resolution.\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Sophdream.png)\n[Sophomore’s dream]. Algorithms powers Artificial intelligence. How can you define how algorithms, define you.\nAnother important consideration is the nature in which articles, actors and/or agents exist (classically) in a  to the preclusively of all others, as to manifest a form of a ledger; or series of (inter related) lists. \n\n#### The algorithmic society\n\nI firmly believe the use of algorithms impacts our natural world in calculable ways. The application physics, quantum physics, information theory, informatics and its role in social and human consciousness; through the means provided by fields such as those, to communicate; that in-turn forms an interference pattern between choices that are made, and outcomes, is now defined by algorithms. We are saturated in data, whilst knowledge equity, is now considered rarely, to be a valuable asset of a legal person. \n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5b5BDoddOLA?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n#### Is our Consciousness due to a bio electro-chemical *Quantum* Processes\n\nThe field of quantum physics in particular, is an area considered to be beyond the realm of comprehension. There are many contributors, from authoritative sources whose studies and considerations have been used to build machines. The application of these works, as algorithms, to manipulate social-graph informatics infrastructure is well within the field of available science today.\n\nYet the field of consideration has moreover been made in relation to the manufacture of things, rather than the consideration of how it may play a role in consciousness, or moreover; what it means to use science, to make our worlds, a better, more sustainable place. For ourselves, and others.\n\nIt is expected that the advent of quantum computing will disruptively influence the otherwise binary serviced means of analytics and analysis. The means through which some qualities of a ‘quantum infosphere’ can seemingly be achieved, is through the development of tools that makes use of *personal ontologies* via *temporally aligned notation*, within an *socially interwoven informatics,* computational environment.\n\n###### segmentation of informatics structures\n\nThe use of a computational environment built upon a means through which a ‘knowledge banking industry’ provisions personal information spheres, seeks to instrumentally influence the informatics topologies (graph architecture).\n\n> Inforgs are able to be employed by agents for the purpose of evaluating complex interference patterns brought about by the acts, arts and interactions of humanity with the natural world and the artificium universitas in which humanity preserves custodianship.\n\nThis theorem, should be technically possible today through the application of implicitly defined, information theory, in relation to the use of APIs provided by existing stakeholders (ie: leading social-network-silos).\n\n> Whether it be for targeted advertising or otherwise. How these systems actually work, is now considered to be proprietary ‘knowledge equity’ of the relevent providers.\n\nGiven it is the case that these international organisations cannot manually process everything; the role of artificial intelligence is increasing exponentially.\n\nMachine Learning and other forms of Artificial Intelligence Agents form an artificial ‘sense’ of ‘cognitive’ function through the practice of consuming very large amounts of information made available to it, as to form an evaluation framework that, whilst often related to probability, forms the means to engender a yes/no answer as to present a result. It is important for the *useful purpose* of these agents; to make distinct that which is consistent with an informatics embodiment of our “natural world” and/or ‘truth’. The intangible constructs of informatics system forms; cause impacts in the real world. \n\n> In effect, the information systems design methodology becomes instrumental in the means and methods used to shape our world.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means in which rules are applied, renders an inexorable influence upon the governance of the health of our environment. </span>\n\nIn nature, the manner in which risks are managed is by ensuring autonomy of individual organisms, in a manner that does not preserve significant factors of risk across the species should a problem exist within an isolated organism or group; as is currently applied artificially, by the highly centralised nature of business systems logic, as is applied globally through current applications.\n\nThrough the practice of converting the means in which information is managed to become ‘human centric’; the acts of humans as individuals are brought into the equations used by others for other purposes. \n\n> We are furnished the means to reconsider virtue and relevance for areas of science used to define a structure for humanity as the seminal actors for all environments, as may otherwise evolve as to serve the best interests of *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">persona artificum &amp; ficta</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n> \n> A knowledge banking industry puts humanity in control of artificial intelligence related systems.\n\n##### Bringing Human Experience into the Dynamics\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my work, i have considered the use of cryptography, linked-data related technologies in a manner that is paired with considerations of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the</span>* dynamics, as explained by way of quantum physics theory; which i don’t really claim to understand, other than noting the algorithms do exist and can be applied online to social-systems. \n\nThe inspiration for having started these works back in 2000, was brought about in relation to considerations of how neural synapses worked; which was a field of accolade studied by my grandfathers cousin, [john carew eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1963/eccles/biographical/). Interestingly, it has later been found this work has been [cited by works](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.2) consistent with the form of views produced overtime. \n\nThe hypothesis now-therefore becomes;\n\n> is it the case that the design of our infosphere, or our information management systems, can be shown to cause harm to the natural world as a consequence of its design and the unmet challenges that can be altered; through the application of a knowledge banking industry. Is it the case, that the giant global graph, can do that today?\n\nIs it the case, that by ‘bringing the observer into the equastion’ (the human) by enabling their means to store and manage the use of AI on their behalf, as is used by a dynamic agent; that the way societal choices manifest can, in-turn, radically change the way we consider the meaningful use of concepts such as “moral grammer”.\n\n> Does human consciousness, have something to do with quantum physics; and if it does, should the algorithms that apply the use of those natural process related faculties; be identified and made ‘commons’.\n> \n> #### Moral Grammar\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kr2K8mo-A5g?rel=0&start=4898\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nA ‘human centric web’ seeks to provide adherence to the principle that natural person be engendering support for the inscribed mechanics, of their temporal conscious existence in the natural world.\n\n> The continual development of ICT and the records produced by it will deliver exponentially growth of information stored about our lives to seemingly limitless levels of dynamic resolution.\n> \n> Truely, there are increasingly fewer secrets.\n\n##### Rationalising the storage of pervasive surveillance\n\nThe information management systems design methodology, influences both realms of a data-subjects role in the natural and artificial realms of human socioeconomic existence; and the formative environment in which consciousness becomes dynamically aligned. \n\nWhen considering the socio-economic influences in geopolitical (law) terms, whilst treating separately; work embodied as proprietary rights (corpus), commons (natural world) and personal works; as is required for governance of the individual personhood and of all persons within a dynamic environment; we are now recorded and employed by ICT that supports non-linear enquiry.\n\nThe illustrated concept of time-travel isn’t about jumping into a machine; rather, the concept that extends from our ability to now use old media, old records, to spend some time in the present, engaging in the past.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rDoS7XErcw?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n##### Your temporal &amp; machine readable record\n\nThe notes on an AI based [re:animation of persons](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/reanimation/), to some-degree discusses this concept in a more accessible manner; noting, the resolution of records stored today pales in comparison to what is going to be created as [Web of Things](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/web-of-things-iotld/) ( or Internet of Things) will do to society, in exponential ways.\n\n> What is the ‘role of the observer’, and who is defined as the observer; who is defined as the legal actor, and who is defined as a stakeholder.\n\nIs it reasonable to expected that our information systems be defined as to yield new means in which the consequential narrative of defining an interpretative value of ‘truth’; be better equipped through the media format made use of to do so?\n\nCan these known problems be expressed by way of physics and other fields of science? \n\nDo false statement, and their interference patterns, algorithmically deliver programmable derivatives that can be relied upon; to be safe, as intended, as if; proper, or reliable; if it were the case, that it was the intended purpose.\n\n##### **The importance of relations &amp; the role of quantum physics in Consciousness.**\n\nJohn Bell showed that the quantum predictions for entanglement are in conflict with local realism.

I suggest that in a similar way, the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made. There is no way to refer to reality without using the information we have about it. Maybe this suggests that reality and information are two sides of the same coin, that they are in a deep sense indistinguishable. If that is true, then what can be said in a given situation must, in some way, define, or at least put serious limitations on what can exist.”*\n\nSource: [Message from the Quantum](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nBy considering the notations of  Stapp who favors the idea that quantum wave functions collapse only when they interact with consciousness as a consequence of “orthodox” quantum mechanics. \n\n*“In order to make quantum mechanics work, you’ve got to bring the human agent into the equations of quantum mechanics which are designed to explain human experience.”*\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYPjXz1MVv0?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nit is problematic that the means through which these works have been created has absolutely nothing to do with linked-data or the means through which these works may be applied to artificial intelligence, semantic web powered, decentralised systems; so, the context needs to be adapted.\n\nYet; The illustrated problem when applied to that specified purpose; may provide some reason as to why the *corpa*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &amp; </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">persona ficta </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we have defined </span>artificium (artificially); as to still now dislocate the human to the infosphere now maintained by way of artificium agency; and, the means in which the records pertaining to us are continuing to be maintained; is now therefore able to be shown to be causing distortions to our shared reality, due to the design.\n\nthese distortions have seemingly been purposefully applied to make limits.\n\n#### The Making of Quantum Physics, to be Confusing\n\nThe statements made by ‘experts’ and available press, are at best confusing.\n\nThe publication by MIT technology review “[Chinese satellite uses quantum cryptography for secure video conference between continents](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610106/chinese-satellite-uses-quantum-cryptography-for-secure-video-conference-between-continents/)” highlights the use of quantum physics related concepts, for use on communications technology. A linked and related article; [First Object Teleported from Earth to Orbit](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608252/first-object-teleported-from-earth-to-orbit/) states talks about the use of entanglement. “This occurs when two quantum objects, such as photons, form at the same instant and point in space and so share the same existence. In technical terms, they are described by the same wave function” meanwhile talks made available by Google “[The Quantum Conspiracy: What Popularizers of QM Don’t Want You to Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc)” (long and convoluted video, noting i disagree in some areas, personally) seems to start-out by suggesting what has been discussed by the MIT technology review articles, couldn’t possibly occur, yet over the course of the hour long video continues to present an array of mathematical expressions, that seemingly shifts the linguistic methods in which a concept is discussed, to a format that is painful to go through and watch; whilst most useful, for software development purposes.\n\n*I find the existing materials confusing and seemingly conflated by marketing related linguistic methods, to be perceived to be a more specialised field than is reasonably true otherwise.*\n\nPeople independently make choices every moment in the real-world, why is it that the ability to make choices, be subjugated due to the creation of a new communications medium where ‘experts’ define how it works.\n\nIn a broader environment where many presentations relate to a person seeking new forms of income; and that all specialised industries, have got a bunch of people in it with their own problems, as we all do; and so therein, given the concept of ‘observing something’ is debated even by the experts;\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZacggH9wB7Y?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n###### can quantum physics equastion be employed to affect the human condition?\n\nthe question becomes reinforced once again; about whether information science can be used to produce improved measurement apparatus (and means to make use of), somehow via ICT, to influence consciousness…\n\nAn article published by BBC titled ‘[organisms might be quantum machines](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160715-organisms-might-be-quantum-machines)‘, alongside another more recently title [the strange link between the human mind and quantum physics](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170215-the-strange-link-between-the-human-mind-and-quantum-physics) continues to consider the concept in various ways (notably including considerations about [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)) – perhaps that’s how those Chinese scientists got the jobs to be involved in making the technology discussed in the MIT articles above, who knows, perhaps it’s recommended for those interested in finding out, to go about trying it); but no so far as the applied considerations relate to the function of google, facebook, linkedin and similar (other than showing the presentation of these works to their software developers); or the means (or implications) of making something different, when considering the role of physics as does intersect between informatics / information systems, perception and the development of what it is we call ‘consciousness’, thought, and our role through personhood / agency; of being made able to make good decisions.\n\n###### The debate about the Application of[ Quantum Algorithms](http://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/) on the Social Graph\n\nSo, it seems there’s enough debate about whether and how quantum physics plays a role in consciousness, which in-turn supports the information theory premise through which, consideration is made about the role of entities and definitions of capacity; as to form interference pattern, in relation to that entity. That these interference patterns may well algorithmically, in-turn, form the material basis through which change and influence is applied to that entity. \n\nOne of the many references that exist, include the page hosted by stanford university on [Quantum Approaches to Consciousness](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.2) (in-part involving my grandfathers cousin, [eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/eccles-bio.html), whose work, first inspired my own back in 2000) whereby the relationships brought about by the work on how consciousness neurologically works and the relationships informatics are influenced by that; to formatively distinct, work on quantum physics; does indeed, in some way or another, relate to each other – whilst the scope of impacts, are unknown.\n\n>Therein it is noted, as it is otherwise noted above; In an interview of 2006, Stapp (2006) specifies some ontological features of his approach with respect to Whitehead’s process thinking, where actual occasions rather than matter or mind are fundamental elements of reality. They are conceived as based on a processual rather than a substantial ontology. Stapp relates the fundamentally processual nature of actual occasions to both the physical act of state reduction and the correlated psychological intentional act.\n\nBut the implication is, that if this does stimulate changes on a biological basis, it is not dissimilar in effect, to any other form of implemented constraint.\n\n##### The battle to be a beneficial owners of knowledge equity\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nAt a level at which conscious mental states and material brain states are distinguished, each conscious experience, according to Stapp (1999, p. 153), has as its physical counterpart a quantum state reduction actualizing “the pattern of activity that is sometimes called the neural correlate of that conscious experience”.”*\n\nTherein, the nature of existence and the characteristics of ‘interference patterns’ were first studied by way of Youngs Interference Experiment, in which a source of light (wave) or movement of a wave (particles), when passing through a barrier that incorporates two slits; leads to a phenomena of the formation of multiple waves on the opposing side of the barrier. \n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jqm4f55soJQ?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThrough the use of this illustration, the means in which to better understand the nature in which all interactions cause an effect which is not simply able in anyway to be isolated but rather maintains a relationship to quantum entanglement and [wave-function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse) through which the tooling to form a measurement apparatus that in-turn provides answers to the question first raised in 1935 “[Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284/files/PhysRev.48.696.pdf)” in which the constituency of causality by association to temporal ontological notation, can to form means in which to analyse a complex, static, and isolated circumstance, pertaining to a subject; as simply as to analyse the interaction of two actors in isolation to all others. \n\nThis modal environment is thought to provide assistance in forming a model for understanding the infinitely more complex version of reality; that can be made known, through the study of the effects interactions with others have upon everything. \n\n##### Extension of custodianship of what becomes our history\n\nThe memory of computers when adapted to store in high resolution large volumes of information about the lifecycle of any actor, far outstrips human capacities. yet these mediums are dynamic in nature, the data can be easily changed; and there are currently few custodians. The means to make use of that medium, brings with it, a new range of considerations relating quantum theory to information theory, and the application of those works with respect to artificial intelligence systems.\n\nTo preserve a human centric means for informatics architecture, storage and permissive capacities; through which agents, are defined to query and interact. The quandary, ‘ripple effect’, is in-turn caused by the design of the informatics system; and the current design, does not well support humanity.\n\nSo the reason why its really very important to build a ‘human centric web’ and moreover, a ‘knowledge banking industry’; may be a problem that can be shown in relation to the use of physics, and stuff we don’t understand; that says in-turn, its amongst the most important things we need to do if we want to progress as a species and improve the way we define our ‘interference patterns’ with the world around us and all natural life, in our natural world.\n\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/b6/14/40b614606c955a16220a180057f56579.jpg)\n\nBy defining a new, modern modal medium; records made use of in the infosphere, are made up of the informatics constructs defined in personal inforgs; which render personable definitions of *ontological design* – alongside the means in which the broader realm of the infosphere is supported as to become better equipped.  This in-turn, empowers us as humans to make use of the complex, repercussions effect, through which, in a temporal frame of influence and context; \n\nThe manifestations of what it is to be made able, to socially consider identity, causality, and in relation to conscious human actors as is temporally managed by way of electronic records; the forms of information management systems structures, better suited to the needs of AI and the natural world it depends upon and is designed otherwise, to serve.\n\nYet moreover; Its far more useful to get stuck into the practical elements of how to build a profitable knowledge banking industry.\n\nAt the end of the day, economics, is presently made to be the main priority.\n\nYet irrespective of how well our internet elders, run some of the largest and most pervasive companies in the world; they simply don’t solve the problems.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GV0A82TCrf0?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nThe way, our history, will be manifestly put back in the hands of the people, is through the development of a human centric web, a knowledge banking industry; an international, socio-economic system, like the formation of a banking sector of relevance, in making of an age for *our algorithmic society*."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/the-need-for-decentralised-open-linked-data/","title":"The need for decentralised Open (Linked) Data"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 564\ntitle: 'The need for decentralised Open (Linked) Data'\ndate: '2018-10-02T16:37:27+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=564'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n### (DRAFT)\n\nthere are an array of considerations relating to how it is that resources such as those produced by wikimedia, be decentralised, in a manner that supports version-control (cooluris) alongside other characteristics.\n\nSome of these requirements include;\n\n#### **Geography (“Space”)**\n\nGeographic spaces in-turn pertain also to law; in which some predicates include the means in which to temporally define means for association to private space.\n\nThe means in which to make addressable rights as they pertain in a temporal format to places is a matter of importance with particular regard to the utility of modern interfaces such as ‘Augmented reality’ head mounted eyeglasses or smart phones, in addition to IoT applications; and the means in which to preserve privacy as is defined by rules that may be applied to geographic space. \n\nWhilst the means in which any space may first be made addressable is a constituent of the civics info sphere; the broader notation of proprietary rights is intended to be performed by act between various forms of persona ficta and persons; in which space may be applied conditional rules as to preserve privacy, protections from electronic torts —&gt; and to ensure kids are not encouraged to play virtual games on freeways.\n\n#### **Language**\n\nThe basis to almost all systems of societal interaction is language. Language is not simply verbal (phonetic) or text (written words) but is also inclusive to gestures and other body language, paintings, song-lines, dress / garments, alongside other symbols, ‘social concept’, communicable mediums and related embodiments. These constituents of cultural epidemiology have traditionally been formed by way of geographic region; whilst more recently through the utility of the world wide web in particular; may pertain to groups whose origins are native to the infosphere.\n\n#### **History**\n\nThe history of environments may have complex multiplicity; whilst the analysis and interpretation of records provide some basis for inferred relations considered to be fact; whilst the conditional logic as is inferred by way of a reductionist format by way of the correlation of invoked new influences; may bring cause to form new insights otherwise made less capable of consideration. \n\n#### **Law**\n\nLaw is amongst the more important areas in which the employ of ontological design may meet challenges of how to afford the translation of legal definition as made distinct by region; may in-turn form means for dynamic international agreements in which a purposeful common-meaning may be obtained. \n\nLaw is subject to changes overtime and the means in which to refer the manifest nature of the laws that were relevant at any particular time; also, provides context that may otherwise be less considered in the semantic relations of records used without means of agents made capable to determine semantic inferences.\n\n#### **Algorithmic Derivatives (“machine-learning” artifacts)**\n\nA deterministic mechanism is defined in which the natural world forms an interference pattern as it is transferred into an infosphere environment as to be made use of by agents; in a manner that may be regarded to be rendered governance, custodianship, operation and management by the express and sole responsibility of human actors in which all acts in relation to others form a constituent of a broader infosphere of accountable, temporally traversable inferencing frameworks empowered by machine readable informatics.\n\nIrrespective of the form in which these machine-readable embodiments be made necessarily articulated; the intent of so resourcing a means in which the natural world is by considerations of ‘commons’ made accessible; is for the express purpose of a trusted network of privately operated ‘inferencing’ services to facilitate interpolar communications events between the dynamic inforg of human actors in utility of the manifest notations made by said actor; and the means in which dynamic representations be furnished in a temporally relevant environment overtime; that may in-turn be referenced to in a non-linear manner as to improve our broader capacities as humans to undertake provenance evaluation of any query and related inference related knowledge processing task/s. The means in which this can only be made possible; is if the means in which to obtain the relevant ‘machine learning’ derivative outcome be made available privately to the agent elected by the human subject with no such right or privilege as to circumvent the human rights of the individual; as to seek to usurp any human moral right as it pertains to dignity in any way that may be considered a form of ‘golden handcuff’, modern slavery, forced labour, or similar; as defined contextually by means of the infosphere; through the application of governance, with open-linked-data."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/the-vision/","title":"The Vision"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 461\ntitle: 'The Vision'\ndate: '2018-09-25T14:46:01+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=461'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nAn [**inforg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) is an informationally embodied organism, entity made up of information, that exists in the [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere). These informationally embodied organisms are also called natural agents.\n\nImagine a world where our information technology is provided in an entirely different way, built upon new and different commercial footings designed to support your means to manage your inforg.\n\nImagine if all the core technology tools had been made to connect all existing software systems, and change the way data is stored and made use of to enable you to store all the information about you. \n\nImagine if all the things others needed to store about you could be securely linked to your data storage system.\n\nImagine if the Artificial Intelligent Agent that interacts with your use of online tools, was defined by you; rather than the publisher or host of your content.\n\nCan imagine a world without banks? Now consider that we live in a world without knowledge banks.\n\nOur society is able to change to use technology, to make knowledge banking industries today. If it chooses to…\n\nThe means to produce and deliver the legal and technical apparatus to define an evolutionary foundation for the knowledge economy is available today.\n\nWe can change the way we store and make use of data, in a manner that requires a ‘knowledge banking industry’ to work, that is built upon works that have technically been under development since around the turn of the millennium.\n\nThese global standards based, software ecosystems, establish the opportunity to bring to market – solutions for citizens and their economies.\n\nHumanity has lost control of the effects its information systems have upon it, and a knowledge banking industry is needed to take it back. The need for a knowledge banking industry is clear, present and needed urgently. \n\n#### What is a Knowledge Bank?\n\nThe technical apparatus provide the means to support a persons needs for data storage and curate the use of information and things, that their information systems powers. This is not unlike a web-hosting provider, although there are an array of distinct differences.\n\nA knowledge bank provides the standardised means for humans to define the way artificial intelligence works for them. It does this using semantic web technologies. All types of applications and devices can be made to work with semantic web technologies, and it is the case today that many already do.\n\nA Knowledge Bank acts as a fiduciary like a doctor or lawyer. Their job is not to have any beneficial ownership over ‘your inforg’ and as part of their job they need to protect you if anyone wants to get access to your data in any way.\n\nWhilst the only organisation who may legitimately have the ability to force access is the law-enforcement agencies relating to where you live, in your land ruled by law; your knowledge banking provider is designed to temper their requests and ensure they’re lawful.\n\nA knowledge bank provides the ability to ‘time-stamp’ and support your needs for more sophisticated enterprise services as an individual; such as cryptographic tools (access control), security and technical support, maintain back-ups, protect against exploitation online and support for your privacy.\n\nA knowledge bank provides you a place to store your private and personal information and blend the use of it, via advanced software, with all the other information that is being constantly produced by you, to improve outcomes for you, based on truth and the ability for you to collect the definitive evidence.\n\nA knowledge bank is a safe place for you to store your electronic financial and ‘identity’ instruments.\n\nA knowledge bank provides the means to identify what it is you do, and provide you the means to prove it. A knowledge bank, provides you the means to make use of the small amounts of information you have and produce, and network it with the knowledge that’s available from across the world to form better insights into the circumstances of your decisions, and how to improve.\n\nA knowledge bank, supports your means to transfer between providers based upon its use of software technology standards. Knowledge Banks provide the fundamental apparatus required to support advanced public statistics that help change public policies and enable your representatives to put the money where its needed to address the problems no one can solve by themselves.\n\nKnowledge banking, changes the media landscape by forming a new medium that is not built upon advertising funded messaging and discovery services.\n\nKnowledge Banking produces the knowledge layer to the web, to be human centric, for our human centric natural world.\n\nA knowledge banking industry also produces a ‘software as a utility’ industry in parallel. it does this by changing the way applications online work, by removing the means through which the application depends upon storing all of the consumers information to make their business work.\n\nA *knowledge banking* industry, is core infrastructure for our natural world in our modern age. Without one, our world will continue to distort uncontrollably.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/WebCivics Medium Posts/A Future For Australians/","title":"A Future For Australians"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"I am a little distracted today, as I consider the implication of various present-day global affairs; through the lens of what it is that I am able to best interpret from a variety of media sources, and how to write, towards the growth of solutions that present opportunities with a spirit of optimism.\n\nThis might be interpreted as being a type of ‘rant’, alternatively; the lack of spending a great deal of time drafting it, may lead to other sorts of objections; but, I’m not looking for narrow minds…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Mw-bqj0oPCx62fpdXcIvNg.jpeg)\n\nNeeded an Image — for the post — this one seemed like a fun option…\n\nSetting aside all of the politics, the bureaucratic nonsense and nonsensical debates; that too often relate to a very different series of considerations that are only able to be built upon by persons with ‘inside knowledge’ that provides different derivative ‘understandings’ of real-world situations…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VGOlRyr4RQZkjBdJ3MBSqw.png)\n\nGrowth Cycles…\n\nThe other image i thought of; is one i made to illustrate the cycle of growth; where people need Access, to opportunities, which engenders growth through the development of new skills which creates new tools, that provides access to new opportunities.\n\nThe consideration being; How is it that we are **_best_** able to figure out a course, pathways forward; that is suitably equipped to optimise productivity and capability of persons, throughout our Great Nation.\n\nA means to responsibly support the needs of competitive industries and activities; but also, a means to better address our shared needs to improve our collaboration infrastructure, our cooperative means to do work, in new ways with new tools; to supportively engage on a basis of fair dealings for accelerated returns. A means to adjust some of the anti-patterns that have emerged threatening to cause us harm.\n\nFrom a ‘high-tech’ point of view, I reach into fields of ontological design and causality associative theorem to consciousness and physics; as may be expressed via mediums that seek, to solve or improve upon issues in various fields including but not limited to those within the field of cyber security. I frankly, have no idea how it is any sensible person or persons believe; a ‘cyber security’ approach can be materially brought about upon a basis that the foundational causal links associated to human functions, be considered ‘out of band’ — not for all cases, but just the opportunistic ones…\n\nHow can any sort of cyber-physical infrastructure seek to perform a trust-worthy ‘cyber-security’ function; when, the fundamental agents associated to any such form of ‘man-made’ infrastructure; are by design, not intended to be the primary beneficiaries of that infrastructure, or its protections.\n\nAn AI design, that seeks to engender a programmatically dissociative & dynamic cyber-physical, socio-economic influence capability; that can be employed to engender probabilities for deterministic ‘futures’. A design, preparing for advancement in the field of ‘tooling’ that takes advantage of advanced fields of science and tech; to manipulate the quantum state, of our realms.\n\nI wonder; if those charged with the responsibility, those who’ve ‘taken control of the funds’, to deliver; I wonder if it is the case, that they know what it is they’re toying with, whether the implications are well known… I watch films, finding solace in the knowledge that they’re declaratively works of fiction; quite different to the channels through which other mediums play games, influence, seek ‘plausible deniability’ or other anti-patterns, that are increasingly harmful.\n\nTherein; I consider the shifts, from the time of the spear; that some may relate to traditional lore and justice; others, may consider in relation to the ‘Holy Lance’, the battle between ‘good’, and evil.\n\nYet in most parts of the world, whilst some still use knives to cause injury to others, in some areas; mostly, knives are used for the preparation of food and materials; and indeed also in medicine, surgery. Whilst not a ‘spear’, there is still a point. Politics shifted from spears to Pens, some time ago; certainly linked to the growth of an information age linked to the growth of print era tools…\n\nYet this has all changed again; so very quickly, now it is not so much about the ‘pen’, but rather the ‘mouse click’, as represented by a ‘curser’ shown, on a ‘screen’… overtime this too shall change…\n\nBut when thinking about coherence, or causal normative occlusion; a consistency links to ‘ideas’…\n\nThe ‘idea’ to find and forge means that supports how it is, people unite, work cooperatively; achieve set goals, and overall, most importantly — strive, to thrive and promote betterment in our real-world.\n\nWhich all seems fairly decoupled to the pre-text deliberations about how it is we’ve been making such enormous investments into advanced apparatus, tools, electronics — that is used to distance us, from each-other; save circumstances where some person, deemed ‘clever’, figures out how to put a ‘toll’ on the engagement medium; like a troll, on a bridge requiring taxes — because they’re a troll…\n\nIts strange, how fables have a means to carry old stories that link to various forms of moral grammar that can be understood by many building forms of psychological bridges linking people, who may otherwise feature character from many diverse differences, linked to that concept — human agency…\n\nSo, whilst I am in a fortunate enough position where I can engage in ‘deep thinking’; and lament the considerations associated with, the causal structure of how it is so many appear to be influenced today.\n\nThe greater consequence of why its worth thinking about, is to figure out how to broker; some fundamental ‘truths’ that can be better employed, to carve paths that encourage better futures. I am fearful of worsening conditions; both domestically and internationally. I am concerned about how some, in a particular class of society; may seek to engender new and different forms of controlling behaviours, abuse behaviour, to fix problems of their own making. History is littered with examples where a few have made a mess; and have sought to clean-up those problems, by engaging in behaviours that make ‘cheap’; life, others, earth.\n\nSo, part of the solution to learning how to better influence these environments; associates to knowing how to stimulate opportunities that appeal to their AI influenced psychopathy; built upon a desire to promote the deliverance of support, or moreover resourcing; to serve their own desires.\n\nAnother part of that same solution; is to look at how longer-term solutions can be better established in the near-term, to diminish the environment of ‘warfare’ put upon said minds; leading to ill-effects.\n\nPart of the problem about how this could be achieved; is that traditional hierarchical structures are more easily ‘influenced’ by these pre-existing systems and group governance frameworks; than is the case for other solutions, that may have radically improved capabilities to transition societies in radical ways, but will be vastly more disruptive.\n\nIf a society is built upon the principle that its safety is built upon its capacity to have people ‘best equipped’ to engage in acts of violence; then if that changes, if the world around that community, that society changes; that the skill of psychologically having the most desirable traits required to punish others with a spear; then a society operated with tools such as pens, paper and gun-powder; with medicines from advanced cultures, linked to space infrastructure, linked to globally distributed energy consuming capabilities funded by all nations; for the administrative benefit of only one; well, one way or another — change, is undoubtedly disruptive.\n\nThere are questions that some who now lead; may well, not be interested in engaging with — in good faith. They may be interested in trying to figure out how to circumvent risk, but ‘cyber peace fair’ (fair dealings); isn’t really, what it is they specialise in; perhaps, in a life linked to many sacrifices. Yet even with said persons, where a dedication of life has been put towards the ideological pursuit of goals. If a path, to better find those goals is found, is explored, and fundamentally sought; then, depending on what it is that path seeks to discover and bring about; the good ones, will still back it; and more importantly, they will back it up. In this situation, I think, the bigger, greater ‘goal’, is about the advancement of our societies and through peaceful works, with cyber-peace-fair infrastructure; tooling required to radically improve productivity and our shared knowledge of our world; and the many little worlds that are built within it, we have a capacity to transition to a new age.\n\n> A Knowledge Age….?\n\n> An epoch level shift in how it is our societies are made able to function…\n\nA capacity to take into consideration, our capacities, to better built upon our means, to engage on a basis of shared values not to harm people, or to go against the principals we espouse to be of most importance, as is written into our books, our laws, our cyber-space realms of records said to be of meritorious purpose; a future, that has much greater hygiene.\n\nWhen thinking about pathways that could be forged to investigate opportunities linked to how it is means to progress from our status quo; to a future, extensible environment; that improved how, how it is we attend to our needs… Part of this entire ecosystem must be about how we better care for the needs of young-ones. How it is, we’re able to triage inequities, now that ‘boomers’ have got the effects upon the world that are so easily linked to their name-sakes; global problems, have now gone ‘boom’; increasingly, it’s time to send them to homes; whilst we figure out how to take care of them, as disabled persons increasingly dependent upon the capacities of those who have not had similar opportunities to build a life of dignity; who they, as elderly, still seek to serve the old.\n\nIt does not seem reasonably sensible or fair to suggest the means for young women to meet the expectations of our modern times; and their needs as persons, are now so much better than before. It is not fair to suggest it is the problem of young people, that the costs linked to seeking to get the skills, the knowledge required to get into gainful work, with increasingly less protections; are solely the problems of those young people; that the means for young people, to have secure shelter, build families as young people — that this is all part of what it is the ‘boomers’ have delivered ‘for them’…\n\nThe boomers, who more often than not — own most of those unaffordable houses; in a society, where global competitors jostle for new forms of rents, to be built and ladened upon the young.\n\nThis is not a moral economy… whilst there is no bombs dropping, if social policy ensured all matters were easily able to be taken to a legal professional and subsequently heard and resolved in courts; then, the old may complain about ‘sustainability’ as the consequence to them may be like, bombs dropping’, not because the problems are not real; rather, because, that’s not how it works for them.\n\nThe complicated underlying issue; that has an array of enormously tied implications to the various deliberations canvassed earlier above; is that we cannot build solutions that afford ‘cyber security’ or sustainability or support our means to ‘care for the old people’, if we do not have a ‘moral economy’. The fundamental series of issues or elements, that is largely well beyond our means of control or influence; indeed, a great deal of the underlying factors link to science or ‘discoveries’ (ie: physics) rather than ‘man made’ things, in isolation to all other form of related consideration…\n\nThe fundamental issue is — this cyber infrastructure — well — in-order for it to work at all, some agents, not all, not necessarily linked to any particular geographic of jurisdictional place; some agents, will increasingly be able to ‘see’ all, that is going on, and by software, make decisions.\n\nA Snippet considering ‘space-time’, in relation to consciousness (and implicitly, AI)\n\nSo, if there’s a plurality of opportunities for different kinds of futures at the moment; maybe, those different opportunities, those different futures; are slowly collapsing, like a form of complex ‘wave function’; most don’t really care for that kind of speak, so we’ll just refer to it as ‘causality’… The ways, means, lenses and what it is we define as ‘solutions’, deployed as infrastructure today, they’re going to have an impact that is likely to have some fairly long-lasting impacts.\n\n> SO, who do they serve? Or what does it serve?\n\nAre we ‘Fighting’, for the young’…?\n\nI think; it is fairly, clearly articulatable to note that there are many ‘opportunities’ to have a deep, hard & meaningful look at how it is we are presently building infrastructure; to support, our growth.\n\nWe have MANY opportunities to look at how to better employ infrastructure to support young people and how that may in-turn transpose to a means that defines better solutions for middle aged persons; and through those sorts of deeper considerations, look to rebuild a new form of moral economy.\n\n> Today, its not at all sensible to suggest ‘housing’, is materially a real-world issue.\n\nCountries such as China have demonstrated that they are able to deploy hospitals for thousands, in weeks. If we wanted to produce low-cost housing, housing that was cheaper to ‘pay off’ than rents; that is something, that could be done.\n\n> The problem is not technology, it’s an issue of rent-seekers.\n\nIf we wanted to bankrupt the money launders, the experts in financial crimes; we could do that so much better, but the consequence is — that we’d need to better support the needs of low-paid, or unpaid workers. We’d need to better address the definition of ‘work’ and what that means today.\n\nWe’d need to figure out how to support capacities that aid in collaboration, cooperation; in the ability for people to, without fear, go about contributing towards the growth of some sort of meaningful derivative outcome; building upon the work produced by others, without having to damage the productivity related factors for all involved, linked to worries about whether good work, useful work, productivity growth of solutions towards some sort of meaningful, useful pursuit; whether, people who do that — will be paid, will be essentially incorporated into the economic framework associated to how it is that work is grown from ideas, to outcomes; by people, working.\n\nWe’d need to accept; and in-turn support, how it is new fangled things like ‘digital identity’ (which is presently made so very badly); supports activities like civic and civics engagement. Whether it be a person who for reasons beyond their means of influence, need to lay their lifes and all of the information about their lives; into the hands of a court, for a judge to save their lives or decide on critical issues relating to their children; or conversely, condemn them; or whether, its about ensuring people have a capacity to engage in law-making, to support how it is our representative democracy is really made to work; regardless of parties that may oppose its most important purpose.\n\nWithout such things, upon what basis do we define ‘cyber security’, or safety?\n\nWe probably also need to have much more refined ways; of looking at entire energy lifecycles, figuring out how to triage complex charlatans seeking newfound ways to seek rents, usury evangelists; screaming ‘climate change’, but without practical means to support our biosphere or human dignity. The differences therein; linked to peace and implicitly therein also; sustainability…\n\nSadly, its too often been the case; that the evil use-cases find their ways to market; long before the others… First, the bomb drops, like the memories of a boomer; and then, they seek to forge peace.\n\nI think; what we most need, is a way to look at the radical expenditure curve; and the various implicit issues that have come about to exist in our present-day reality; and figure out what we want in 50 years. This isn’t so that some sort of nonsense targets is set, to distract; but rather, big concepts.\n\nHow could a place like Australia support a population of around 100m people…? How much desert could be turned into forests; and what sort of things thought of to support a ‘mission to mars’, has more purposeful application when thinking about, how those sorts of ideas could be applied here.\n\n-   How do we produce better, knowledge based, economic models?\n-   What laws are knowingly irrelevant?\n-   How do we determine ‘public trust’,\n\n_or promote the interests of ‘women and girls’, in truly dignified ways; including, for those who have mental health issues and are heterosexual as it does not appear today, that said persons would be supported to form families when young._\n\n_It is important to question how these sorts of human needs, are really, supported._\n\nIn my opinion; there are significant questions about the reasonable viability of many, various expectations, particularly those accumulated upon girls and young women that do not appear to be fair or reasonable, moverover, abusive.\n\nWhen considering the sorts of issues that are linked, inter-generationally therein; how can ‘knowledge economy’ labour, work and education practices; better, support the opportunities societies can uncover if we are able to figure out how to radically improve life-long growth of persons in a manner that is broadly, attentive of the needs of persons; in modern, improved ways.\n\nThe present-day context of how it is Australia; makes its way, is much more closely tied to the benefits brought about by mining natural resources for exportable profits; than we’d prefer to be the case, into the future.\n\nThe ramification of what this means, is that we now need to figure out how to make better use, provide for improved productivity; and support, of our natural resources; including our people, our minds, our knowledge; and our capacity, to build a place where the best from around the world, want to come and make homes; live with peace, prosperity, opportunity, dignity & innately overall, the greatest opportunities for personal growth of moral wealth.\n\nIf we are to create an environment that is equipped to support rapid growth; particularly given the sparce nature of our present-day population given our geographic displacement on our shared earth; then, we’re going to have to figure out radically improved ways, to make much better use of our existing knowledge infrastructure, to support the growth of a diverse & resourceful knowledge asset base; for knowledge economy, and underpinning — socioeconomic growth.\n\nFrom my point of view; I find it hard today, to hear people ‘speak’ about ‘cyber security’, because, they don’t really want to build infrastructure that’s truly secure; they want to be an exception… The problem with these models; by design implication, what they are making; cannot, ever, be secure.\n\nSecurity isn’t found in tools; its found via the connectivity between our minds, our purpose & our works. If we want to build a safer world, a better world, a world where our biosphere flourishes; providing opportunity and advantage for us, as part of our world; to form better choices, build productivity, engineer solutions that makes use of our advanced cyber-legal business systems realms; to improve how it is, we figure out solutions to problems, we haven’t fixed yet today.\n\nThen the ideology of what ‘security’ means; kind of ends-up translating into the observable patterns, shown today. Our ‘status’, in the present, as ‘observers’; is a manifest consequence of our prior works.\n\nWhilst we may be learning how we can better understand that into the future; it seems foolish to be in a position where it seems now necessary to say, we need to review out methods; if we’re going to figure out how to better refine the attenuation, the ‘signal to noise ratio’, the ability to distinguish between ‘facts’, ‘perspectives’ and fictions; our ability to maintain ‘common sense’, and the underlying infrastructure we require to preserve and grow, our liberalised democracy, our values that when tested; seek to be furnished fairness, due-process & probity in our courts of law.\n\nA vision about what our ‘Australian Way’, means, for Young Australians…\n\nThere are many ways our future may evolve; and I’m still thinking about how best to describe the derivative considerations linked to so many complex underlying ideas and constructs, that I’m able to provide something that is easily considered, able to be dutifully delivered; & impactful, by intent.\n\nWe still now have a capacity to figure out how to better build our future, for Australians.\n\nI suggest we look at how we may better support the sorts of ‘brave conversations’, underpinned by support that helps us explore, innovate & test ‘ideas’ and scenarios; of how we work with our world.\n\nHow we shift our Australia, from a place with a noted history of _theft_; to places, made to work with knowledge; as it has always otherwise been, since men, women, boys and girls — started to build a knowledge culture; without books whilst carrying spears, with many tribes and song lines whilst, etching exemplars of our history — into stones.\n\nSometimes, the path forward can be better understood if people take the time to look back, at History. Arguably, the importance of doing so in our present time; is more important, than ever. We are building a technology environment, we ‘say’ its about health, some say identity; but how is it that these tools, these technology environments will help us better understand our history.\n\nThe issues that I am most concerned about; the issues that should really, keep people awake until they sort out; is the issue about how it is, these tools, these technologies, may well obliterate truth.\n\nIf that occurs, if we let that occur, then I am not sure what I can say about hope, for children. I do not know what I can say, that could justify that sort of act, well beyond the realms of toilet-paper shortages; to something that is far more real, that is not directly tied to types of violence that is war. I do not know how it is that our society can best support thrive-ability if it cannot support truth-telling; I do not know how our society can be protected, if we revoke our dutiful support for rules, by laws.\n\n> Laws made by the representatives of the people; representatives, expected to represent the people of their electorates.\n\n> Citizens, within electorates, who are far more than ‘consumers’, within our roles, as we wield the right to maintain our role as future makers…\n\n> not servants, not slaves, not ‘[things](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/thing)’… rather, people, with thoughts & futures…\n\n_If it is too hard to talk about the extraordinarily complex issues that get built into infrastructure apparatus, such as the sorts of things many consider to be part of what some call ‘cyber’, or ICT._\n\nThen, its time to talk about the sort of future we want to engender for the living, for young adults, for children; for those who can actively do something useful in our world where its demanded they be unpaid; and think, about how knowledge, not just ‘information’, systems that fail to distinguish facts and opinions from fictions; let alone the implications brought about, upon young minds — masked at home or otherwise, by loved ones seeking to keep them safe; what is it we need to do, to do better.\n\nHow can we get onto that today.\n\n-   How do we protect progress, from those seeking out the ‘fat fees’ to stand on the top of a burning pile of nonsense, of their making as persons (legal personalities or otherwise); and try, to figure out,\n-   How we may best build safe tooling;\n-   Safe Environments, capabilities for growth of Moral Economy via a Cyber-Physical fabric,\n\nThat if done properly, will provide security, safety and radically shift our productivity potential — as life works ‘better’ with knowledge."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/WebCivics Medium Posts/A Future to Support Informed Decisions S.T.E.A.M & Stars/","title":"A Future to Support Informed Decisions S.T.E.A.M & Stars"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### A Knowledge Age, will win the war: the battle for how we manage information, & build 21st century societies, on Earth.\n\n_Enormous decisions are being made today; that will impact whether &/or how we are able to form_ **_informed opinions;_** _personally, socially, throughout our world._\n\n**_Introduction.._**\n\nThe global circumstances brought about upon our world; have various underlying factors relating to greed, abuse, wrongs & intended harms.\n\nThe choices that are being executed, so broadly; makes it hard for me to watch nationally provided TV services that say they talk about ‘news’, like its non-fiction all the time.

Some of the oldest records that remain, are statements made etched into stone, into rock.\n\nWritten languages have used an array of mediums; from papyrus and animal hide, through to the creation of canvas, cards, paper and print based mediums. These mediums are not the same as electronic storage methods.\n\n> The vast majority of electronic storage mediums are read/write in nature. The majority of systems used with these read/write mediums, are interconnected to others, most often globally via internet protocol to a plurity of devices.\n\nAs such, these mediums are not similar to print based solutions used earlier.\n\nThe ability to reliably store information on a tamper evident manner, on an electronic medium that is known to have a capacity to ‘keep it’, for longer than a few years has been a long-term challenge. The broader implications (get far worse) when considering how to store information for later usel; for a longer period of time, not just say, a few decades, but ideally — how to keep information in a tamper evident way - that can be later consumed by others, in thousands of years time.\n\n_ends up with problems showing that its not an intended outcome._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gAA0hBbdX_1vURSrES6NYQ.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/There-Cloud-Someone-elses-Computer/dp/B07NWH6ZTD)\n\nThe way we’ve figured out how to more reliably store information over a period of greater than only a decade; has been to ‘put it online’, on ‘the cloud’, where energy is continually consumed to maintain records overtime.\n\nBut the consequence of this method has other implications. These consequences include the inability for the creator of that piece of information to reliably know the material statements / embodiment made at the time of the creation of the information artifact; will remain the same, overtime.\n\n_In most cases, certainty cannot be assured. nor should it be considered reliable._\n\nAnother ‘feature’ links to how the ability to assert permissions is made to work. These include legal concepts, who is entitled to review that material, whether the material can be altered, substituted, removed, fabricated; which brings about other issues, where certainty cannot be assured.\n\n> In-fact, in most cases, the reality is that others are by design able to consume that information, the ability to see who has, isn’t part of how it works; and this, has enormous implications across multiple societal areas.\n\n> The biggest difference between electronic storage mediums vs. former print (or rock) versions; is that, it is natively designed to be consumed by robots, for the beneficial use of the owners of those robots, and their lawful ‘stewards’.\n\nI use the term robot to principally denote software programs / programming.\n\nIt is of course the case that physical ‘things’ (powered by software) is designed, by extension to make use of electronic information; but that’s somewhat secondary, as they’d not work at all without software programs.\n\nWhat people are less aware of; is how ‘robots’ can program ‘human beings’ to perform certain acts alone or in groups; as to execute for engendered benefits. There are an array of examples of this discussed with respect to elections, and indeed also toilet-paper shortages; but this doesn’t adequately illustrate the volume of times every day most people are influenced in some way, by robots.\n\n#### **Law, Lore, Life & Society.**\n\n> Interwoven with the way our societies have formed means to improve support for communications, distribution of information, stories, knowledge; have been various ways through which societies have sought to produce environments that promote the growth of life of human beings and others, ‘biosphere tenants’.\n\nThere’s are so many means to illustrate harms that have been committed upon biosphere tenants. There’s so many examples where an inability to communicate, listen, believe or to behave / respond on a basis of the facts of circumstances, rather than lies and falsehoods, that has led to enormous loss of life. The costs have not only impacted human life, but life, in our biosphere, due to our inability to better manage it, so much more. It is still common for people to talk about improving our environment via language that makes it sound like its a crime against nature; but those voices, do not consider the clearing that occurred, in-order to change swamps and forests to towns. We put value on clearing life; whilst seeking to levy costs on making it, particularly in cases where the objective, is to make new life, self-sufficient.\n\n> Its my thinking, that the vast majority of us as children; are taught about society, about our world, about the vitues of what it is we should grow-up to say, do, how we behave, how we seek help when we need it; how our society seeks to protect a set of values in a particular way, honestly or not.\n\nEach culture appears to have had a variety of notions associated in english, to the concept of ‘good’ vs. ‘bad’ or wrongs; many cultures built systems of laws, fought to extend means for people to live unto the rules defined by those laws.\n\nOthers, had similar concepts; but their lores, had different properties…\n\nMany cultures depended upon writings in books, in writing & print based mediums, supported by libraries and schools that taught people how to read, write and communicate using the languages linked to those mediums.\n\nBoth in these cultures, and in other cultures, ceremonies and songlines harbour great importance; Journeys of experiences of circumstances.\n\nOne of the biggest things that is said to have brought about great leadership in the world, via the ‘western world’,\n\n-   no-matter our capacity to clear lands and build bombs & weapons designed to caused destruction in so many different ways; was that,\n-   There was the underlying concept, that sought to both employ moral considerations that were built into many religious teachings; but also,\n-   To make rules to life, via laws, to which disputes be handled by ones peers in a formal manner.\n\nThese rules sought to both trancend the particulars of any specific religous order or group or language of belief; to something shared.\n\nOur ability to build and maintain these societal pillars relied upon the foundational assumption that the text in the ‘books’ did not change without express consent, which required the publication of a new book; or new statements on another rock.\n\n> A new series of songlines, a new story, a new set of statements that were knowingly illustrated to be ‘known’ to be different for those who had both copies of the statements made in these various former mediums…\n\n_These mediums could not easily change, they were not dynamic and this is no-longer the case._\n\nThe way our dynamic mediums are now sought to be ‘governed’, is with the support of robots; on a world-wide, international basis.\n\nIt seems increasingly dangerous to raise this issue as a point of concern.\n\n#### **Post Covid or Post Democracy?**\n\n**_The capabilities of our communications infrastructure as tools, is truely remarkable and the subject of national and international military secrets._**\n\n> In my opinion, it is a falsehood to suggest that these tools have been designed to support our societies means to live peacefully; and our means to live in an environment of fairness, where those elected act as representatives prosecuting our needs as a democracy. The only reason why this apparent outcome has been brought about is per the design choices made by those who made it, functioning.\n\nThis is not to suggest they’ve got problems that were unintended, indeed, it appears that they are indeed functioning broadly; as intended, with the consequences of how it disaffects others placed squarely into the ‘not my problem’ category, as they go home with the economic rewards for their work.\n\n> The implication is that these systems do not support the means to maintain a representative democracy. It was not designed to do so, they got paid not to do so.\n\nThey do not support the means for people to reasonably have confidence, that they’re going to be supported as to be empowered, appropriately, to engage via our legal systems for prosecuting a complaint, of merit (in reality / per ‘lived experiences’); particularly, if they’re poor and particularly moreover; if they’re a poor human being. This capability does not exist, by their choices.\n\nWhilst Companies, can always be sold, providing the rights to prosecute wrongs to their purchaser; Poor human beings, are merely considered ‘consumers’, encouraged not to keep any records that can be relied upon. Convinced ‘free’ services, from overseas providers, is the better way for their lives & our world, it seems what may occur consequentially, is a new form of slavery that’s simply about how digital identifiers can be used like golden handcuffs; to control the socioeconomic benefits from peoples lives, whilst encouraging foreign governments paid small amounts for their services, support the introduction of ‘universal basic income’ to pay for the slaves.\n\nIncreasingly, its not even human beings that are most involved in making these sorts of statements to people, freed from repercussive responsibilities…\n\nWhilst humanity converts natural resources to different forms of Energy that we consume, so that we can maintain access to information we produce, the information, lawyers like to call ‘data’ for legal purposes; power software robots which are increasingly the ones that are often executing decisions that have been made by someone; or moreover, a very small group of people, somewhere in the world. The ‘beneficiaries’ are shareholders, somewhere, which in-turn engenders a ‘class’ based system, for some purpose, that is then deployed into our world.\n\nThey sell this to us as ‘peace fair’ (fair dealings); when its brain-rape based war-fare; rent-seeking, usury behaviours. There’s no fair-dealings built into these schemas, they say ‘we know nothing’ when in-fact, they know more about people than we want to know. The defence often brought up, is ‘we’ll frighten them if we tell them the truth’, not unlike methods used in past to justify other forms of slavery & war-crimes, for as long as it was ‘profitable’; changes have often lead to great loss. Seems to me, some, of the most senior, are hoping, indeed praying that others who profited with them, will protect.\n\n> Most of the time, the behaviour is fairly predictable.\n\n_The underlying motivation, whilst it does go into complex areas, is broadly about generating money or economic power, which can mean both; getting as much ‘wealth’ as they can create in financial terms, whilst simultaniously diminishing the capacity for others to generate wealth; as to ‘own the pie’, without disputes._\n\nThe reason why this problem is a ‘big deal’, is that the biggest groups, those with complicated interwoven ownership structures ‘under the hood’, well, they’re the same ‘legal people’, who own the infrastructure that collects and stores the information we would depend upon, even if means to take a problem to a court of law was a economically &/or politically viable approach.\n\n#### How Cheap: The insignificance of fees rendered, to sully us all.\n\n> Systems of democracy rely upon a means for people to elect the people who are responsible on behalf of that group of people who share a common geographic area; to act in the interests of that group of people, who elected them.\n\nWhen the ability to do anything, hinges upon what foreigners allow; we no longer have a capacity to maintain a representative democracy.\n\n_The implication brought about also, is that we have limited means to support the core necessary functions required in-order to preserve the sancity of a court of law, the ability for our law to matter most; our ‘peers’ to decide, our fate._\n\nThe Implication becomes one where its not that we’re heading towards a ‘post covid’ world via some ‘luminary’ ‘great reset’ empowered by ‘health credentials’,\n\n> it appears things ‘said’ to form ‘opionions about’ are simply the glossy brochure selling the opportunity to spend more money & support how others make money.\n\n> via a very small group of people, deciding is how a post-democracy world, works.\n\nThe people making these decisions are not those we are led to ‘believe’ are doing it, at least not by my measure. It does not seem to be reasonably the case that our elected members of our houses of parliament, understand the options well enough. In-turn, distractions are well underway via ‘personalised media (plural of mediums)’; an array of ‘conspiracy theory’ fear-mongerous ‘bullshit’, designed to manipulate individuals alongside the masses; computationally influenced, which if called out; and the vast majority of the array are not, a discussion should be had about it in a courts of law, but won’t.\n\nIt seems the only issues discussed in courts of law, are those that progress agenda. There is an underlying defence built into the process; which is to say, that the infrastructure required to provide an alternative, doesn’t exist; which is a true statement, as a consequence of a lack of investment, to bring it about.\n\nAs such, the underlying ‘decision makers’ are those who understand ICT enough, to understand what choices are not being defined, not being invested into; not being clearly presented to the people throughout our democracies as the options that do exist; but are presently considered impossible to achieve. They’re the people, who can define how AI manipulates group entities (legal personalities) as we’ve already made natural persons, mute. This was achieved by simply redefining humanity to be the consumers.\n\nThe reason for this; is not about the people, regardless of their roles. As such, those with an expertise in marketing, or some other field of work; that means for them, they depend upon others to understand other issues of importance are due to the manifest nature of how these systems work, better promoted.\n\nWhether it be how biological sciences relate to various factors linked to viruses; or whether it be various factors linked to information management, the benefit of ensuring propriatery approaches; links to broader agendas.\n\nSo now, in my humble opinion (IMHO); the problem appears to be that, our society has already been taken over. With one command, all the tools we rely upon to communicate, for our society to function; all of this infrastructure, could quickly be turned off; Or, a story manipulated to maintain ‘a ruler of the seven kingdoms’; or as may be said similarly by those waving the holly wood.\n\nThe thing is, the point is about generating wealth. Its not about ‘killing off the ‘slaves’ before’ they’re put to use to benefit those who are seeking wealth. They say ‘be scared of non-white people’, but would it be worse than where we are heading anyway? those whose version of ‘god’, is a white, blue-eyed jesus?\n\n> I was thinking about this problem, how did the slave owners, as shown in holly-wood films to have been reading biblical verse to justify slavery of non-white people; how it is, the United States hasn’t said clearly — jesus, wasn’t ‘white’.\n\n#### **Belief vs. Abuse.**\n\nAs I lament upon the problems, particularly given my personal role in having sought to make tools for good; that are, in my opinion, now being used to do the opposite, by people, whose behaviour is unspeakably — bad. Its _ungodly_.\n\n> I am increasingly concerned that the malignancy built into these infrastructure problems will result in an outcome of war.\n\n> A War, unlike anything ever known possible in human history ever before.\n\n> A Gift, by negligence of our present-day adult generations put upon kids, for profit.\n\n> The thing about this problem, is that the underlying issue that i see a battle coming about to address; given the epic failure, given the absence of penalties, of people who know better; to address serious moral problems.\n\n> Our ICT infrastructure has capabilities, that make the use of the term ‘pervasive survellience’ innocuous and ‘care free’, by comparison.\n\n> Our capacity to use capabilities to harm others; via so many levels, is terrifying.\n\nEven in countries where vast amounts of the population still live without clean water, without basic medicines or schools, and healthy environments; capabilities exist, that should be like a bolt of lightening to strike fear into the shuddering hearts of those who are blinded for a few moments, even on a Sunny Day.\n\nThe cheapest Consumer electronic are not found in western countries, the use of ‘low cost labour’ has not developed enormous manufacturing capabilities in western countries… The beliefs that so many have witnessed and/or experienced, whether it be toilet-paper shortages; or the stories about 5G and microchips in vaccines (rather than more simply linking the supply of vaccine to digital ‘id’); people really don’t understand what to be concerned about, and why it is some of the things they think are so serious; are in real-terms, kinda meaningless…\n\n> If a war throughout our world develops beyond the shadows, the ability to protect ones life, if decided against; can be as surgical as a targeted means to induce disease invoking death; capacity to alienate and/or harm mentally, as to induce a person to kill themselves with a high-degree of probability; or any other broad-ranging capabilities at almost any levels…\n\nWhen i look at what’s going on; i believe there is an economic war underway, indeed i think a dishonest ‘cyber war’ has been carried out since at least 2001 built upon the premise that it’ll protect us all from being ‘terrorised’, and i’m of the opinion, that dishonest position has objectively failed. Billions of people, in the lead-up to an election in one country on this planet, were so terrorised, 3.5Bn people reportably were locked in their own houses, many, by choice; some, its said by force; but often, the law was fairly unclear irraspective of what American Global Cyber Media infrastructure had to say.\n\n> Am i anti American? no. some, are friends. i just don’t want them to rape us.\n\nI do believe there is a great deal going on, that is absolutely shameful and entirely inconsistant with the rights, duties, responsibilities or lawful capacities furnished to any person; to lawfully be paid to do, to others. I understand the statements made that the human population on earth was about to be decimated, world-wide; but last i checked, it’s grown.\n\nThe main point here is about creating infrastructure that will bring forth a post-democracy world.\n\nIf this was not the case;\n\n-   then they would be investing in commons-infrastructure to support our means to have reliable electronic recordings that far outstrip the features and benefits of what we had with print era tools.\n-   we would have domestic capabilities, that could be used for many things; from helping us to engage with our electorate or eradicating spam or managing our biometric signatures; or,\n-   Being able to walk into a court of law to have clearly ruled upon — whether or not what it is that has happened to someone harmed by others for gainful purposes; is appropriate by law, or not — Regardless of who employs them — if a person or group of persons engages recklessly in unlawful behaviour, the means to ensure those persons are subject to a court of law & maybe prison.\n\n**_This is not what they are doing._**\n\nThis is not what is going on, as people speak about ‘foreign interference’ as though, they’re investing in an inter-domestic, or inter-national approach to the supply of capabilities to ensure our ‘health’ is not exploited, for greed as to cause harm, injury, mental, physical & emotional harms upon public health; for some purpose, they say is binary. Without any meaningful form of accountability; people are swayed by arguments that are about as sensible as having a public official suggest that unless a person can eat an entire cow in one bite, we’re all going to starve.\n\n> “China’s №2 diplomat in Australia says his country should not be considered a “cow” that can be exploited economically while also being plotted against to be slaughtered” Source: [AFR](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/we-re-no-cow-to-be-exploited-says-chinese-diplomat-20210421-p57l1a)\n\n> Is China seeking special treatment? isn’t that how we’re all treated by Americans?\n\nIn many ways, these binary options we’re presented with act to distract from the underlying agenda being prosecuted by those who want (unlawful) control; without encumberances of responsibility, as a globally organised group of legal persons, with local agents; which basically means that they are presenting us with a fallacy of choice… but that’s not what the tech was designed to deliver, so there is a choice, a choice is being made; but,\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zUt7-UmK6QXZbtBpiU2epQ.png)\n\nSource: [https://medium.com/webcivics/inforgs-the-collective-info-sphere-67a660516cfd](https://medium.com/webcivics/inforgs-the-collective-info-sphere-67a660516cfd)\n\n> Under no circumstances will the capacity for natural persons to manage their own identity (and that of their dependents, their children); be allowed.???\n\n> Under no circumstances shall records sought to furnish to a court evidence of facts in relation to the behaviour of others, be provided on a reliable basis???\n\nThey say, this would be a breach of privacy; what it often actually means, is that they’re involved in a war that targets human dignity, and it would be a problem for them to have that clearly described in a way that shows profits.\n\n> The above diagram is part of a broader diagram that was first made around 2011–3; older examples date back to 2000–1… but the purpose of it, was to create an array of domestic industries, world-wide, of ‘information banks’ or ‘knowledge banks’; which in-effect, would function a little like a hosting company, with pieces that are a bit like a financial institution, and other pieces that are a bit like a legal office, working for you. These works have been clearly illustrated to government, who previously advised me, they were not interested in ‘credentials stanards work’ (which they’re now deploying). They’re making choices about records, and it appears they’re making choices about reality vs. made fantasies.\n\nThe diagram linking my intepretive definition of ‘human identity’, isn’t what they want. If they are forced to go in this direction, they will ensure the provenance of how that comes about, is able to take it all down.\n\n> In our western world, there’s a war going on. That’s what this actually means…\n\nWhen people say ‘digital identity’ in the media, they’re not talking about the definition linked to the diagram i’ve noted above. What they’re talking about, is a group of fancy ‘subject identifiers’ whether they be applied upon things or natural persons; that are in-turn designed to provide a tradable means to manage ‘assets’. Through the use of these new forms of ‘handcuffs’, negotiations that are in-turn (given considerations linked to my work on helping to invent it) most likely to also be on a dishonest basis; as the methodologies being employed whilst they do so, is likely legally _uncertain_.\n\nIt is my strong belief, that this, is the manifest creation of abusers, who will loose; making worse a series of behaviours better suited to wrongdoers no-matter their employers (or structure of their organisations) and this ‘winner takes all’ strategy; can only lead to conflict, there is no ‘knowledge’ about it.\n\n#### **The Outcome: A Knoweldge Age**\n\nWhomsoever wins this war, will do so by bringing forth a knowledge age.\n\n> Some years ago, Tim Berners-lee presented, in a talk somewhere, a map of a journey & its future destination in ways that were about the extension of him.\n\n> i’ve used that image in earlier articles that speak to the same destination.\n\n[**A Future Knowledge Age**  \n_A Future that is about engineering for an emergent knowledge age._medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67 \"https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GJra7bGE5s0XAHZCZLfs8w.jpeg)\n\nSource: [W3C Map](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/map/main.jpg)\n\n> There are areas where i can see a story, some that has held true in many ways; others, that have not.\n\n> A good, simple example would of course be SPAM, arguably a problem that has not been solved because of the ‘good guys’ aligned in too many ways, too often, with the bad guys; i guess, that’s because that spend so much time invested in each-other… Will ‘vaccine passports’ result in a solution to kill spam? i think that’s highly improbable. I also think, that says, alot…\n\n> The ‘accountability’ piece; has seemingly been set-aside.\n\nThere are many changes required; and one of the examples that really irratates me, as i see it as a means through which those funded as ‘public servants’ or persons paid to work in the interests of the public, have purposefully sought to produce language that protects them whilst doing the opposite… Protect them, whilst they’re creating policies, systems, laws about how our biometric identifiers, the information that shows everything about our lives be managed by others, suggested that we have no right to ask for it, or to seek consideration about whether or how its used; or how information written in connection to us, about us, is accurate, or not… This example, is centred upon the use of the term ‘data’. This term, data (not knowledge, or information) is employed — because it is known that data is not covered by ‘copyright’ or other laws that could be used to protect persons nor can vocabulary create appropriate semantics with the use of this term ‘data’, to do so.\n\nIf it were considered ‘information’ or knowledge or intellectual property / art of some form; it seems, they’re all devout to the usury of data; which is kinda frightening, as a single silo that sucks it all up from all data-sources globally, would scale capabilities far beyond what could ever be achieved in ‘california’ alone…\n\n> but then, are ants happy in ant farms? what happens when an ant farm owner finds an ant outside of the farm? I imagine its similar to what most people do with ants in the wrong place…\n\nUsing highly sophistocated infrastructure, that is not designed to support human agency nor ‘global peace fair’ (fair dealings); can only progress the problems, towards further harms, injuries, debt and hostilities.\n\nPeople with a mindset trained to kill, are bound to those lessons. We need more people engaged, who have been devoted to seeking justice, fairness and lawful outcomes; particularly those, who have been failed by ‘public infrastructure’. We need to clearly sort out our problems inter-domestically, we need to eradicate money laundering, not fund politicians as a ‘cost of sale’.\n\nThe world, will have something to turn to; if that is not being developed locally, it’ll be developed elsewhere and the outcomes will be desruptive, imo.\n\n> One way or another, certainly also considerate of the implications linked to having the very elderly members of our society who may have trouble even using the basic functions on their mobile phone; define & control ‘power’, at the moment; seems dangerous… But in anycase… At some stage….\n\n> The outcome must end-up with a migration towards a ‘knowledge age’, whomsoever does that, will cure diseases, will bring justice, peace & dignity, for the unjustly harmed.\n\nemploying our infrastructure to advance the abilities, for those empowered with it, to advance productivity and capabilities; and, the means to form meaningfully friendly cooperative frameworks for working in socially beneficial ways with others, will radically outstrip the capabilities of others.\n\nFormer empires built upon unlawful behaviours, wrongs, false statements; should, in a knowledge age, end-up getting entirely dismantled as a consequence of the inability for anyone to justifiably build upon stolen work.\n\nThere will be a migration away from the corruption that has been built around the concept of ‘privacy’ to improve resonance linked to the pursuit of human dignity. The means to better address biosphere challenges, here on earth; will be linked to what people do, not what (or who) people own.\n\nThe advancement of quantum physics related sciences; will forge a path to improve our means to harmonise how it is we speak about god, and what some call the holy spirit, but others more simply consider through the lens of ‘ontological design’. The nuanced differences built into vocabulary, like just, and justice; the merits of a just, war; our means to traige, tyranny.\n\nA future, where those engaged in wrong-doing with intent to do serious injury to others; particularly those who did so for profits are punished, is coming…\n\nThe infrastructure of a knowledge age, will look upon those persons for who they really are and due to the nature of how ICT works, will have a radically different ‘view’ about it; similar yet different to other clinical hardware. A means to ensure that the prosethic extension of self does not control us as property; through the apparatus this war seeks to build today, but rather, that our means to improve our decision making about our lives, is made possible.\n\n> Means to safely consider the merits of the world of animals and our biosphere.\n\nIt will not be because states that act as an enemy of the people through the abuse of [S.T.E.A.M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields) to expliot ‘data’; but rather, that the consequences of what is developing now, means that they’ll be no secrets. The vast majority of the ‘encryption technologies’ we use today will become old. They’ll be like Nazis.\n\nThe old rules, the means to create social encryption; frameworks that depend upon ecosystems of persons who are equipped, will be known to be more important… akin to epigenetics, only at a different sort of level, now debated.\n\nToday, the corruption, of our biosphere, in our biosphere, of our humanity; is so self-evident, there are examples that are so very poor… Its not about god. Its not about good values, and its certainly not about ‘democracy’… I think, the reason why most don’t talk about it today, is due to mortgages & debt.\n\nAs this process that seeks absence of legal responsbility and/or attribution even at the most basic level as to distinguish fact from fictions; it is foolhardy to assume that this is going towards a future, that will serve, children of today. I think, increasingly also; that the root-stem as to why the ‘bs won’t work’, actually comes down to physics; as the imagination is amazing, but not sufficently complex as to be able to win a war of world influence over reality.\n\n> What is most important for those in control, is that they stay in control; even if they _sail the boat under_, at which point, they’ll be the first to take the life-raft.\n\n> The foundations to what is now occurring is built upon a grand, moral poverty.\n\nIf that was not the case; we’d be building different permissions systems, for how we manage ‘our’ knowledge or reality & our means to ensure its abundant use to support ‘our values’, our ‘liberalised democracies’ our courts of law and those who must be encouraged to attend them; rather than harming others, or seeking to submit to abuse by others, who seek the affordances of corruptions to protect them having knowingly harmed others.\n\nInformation, through the remarkable capabilities made, by mankind, gives rise to various possibilities, to various opportunities; which we, as members of our human family are hard-wired to support, what is good; not what is evil.\n\nHumanity was not eradicated in 2020. That’s not what happened. #WakeUp.\n\n#### **What would i do, to get a better outcome…?**\n\nComplaining about things is a fairly selfish thing to do, if you don’t put at least as much effort into trying to figure out what a possible solution might be…\n\nI’ve spent, so many years, working on technology related solutions; only to see how the money flows into it to pervert its values, to be used to hinder not help. I’m now finding the simple process of sitting in front of a screen, fairly traumatic stuff. Its so wierd, but the thing is; i do a bunch of work for good purposes, and as it develops into something useful, the evil comes to take. I’m increasingly thinking about how dynamic AI agents can be targeted at every individual person in extrodinarily complex ways to prosecute agendas… The isolation, alienation of having done such works; unable to say much about it, but seeing how those, who our world is encouraged to trust, employ it… gosh.\n\nThe thing about how these groups work; is that they defend the indefensible, suggesting they’re entirely entitled to commit enormous harms, in a manner that maintains their freedom from prosecution, from penalty for wrongs.\n\nWhen they’re ‘fake people’ (false identifiers, etc.) the environment becomes unsafe. The tactical capabilities taken on by some, most often financially focused persons, who are then in-turn strategically aligned with bad governmental actors seeking to ‘invent the solution themselves’ or get everything for free; who are in-turn economically aligned with the big time financial crimes experts, who are in-turn linked-in with the drug-dealers involved with large-quanties and sex-marketing / trafficking of women… Fairly nasty stuff..\n\n> Highly recommend doing an Audit on the use of prostitutes; once you’ve figure out who and what they’re linked to; do a mental health evaluation on those prostitutes, see, who they may serve…see whether its a choice for them, or not.\n\nIncreasingly those in the environment, fortify their positions, ideologically.\n\nThere is a lack of community, a lack of care or interest for those whose lives are in jeporody, those who live in poverty whilst apparently ‘leading the world’ in fields of STEAM that change our world, ubiquitously. Its nasty. Whilst i’m surprised they want to be personally attributed to the issues, only briefly noted above that are linked to the ‘economically equipped’ constituencies within these communities (check-out their business systems, how and who they pay to do any work at all; then see what’s ‘promoted’); its just really, nasty stuff; which is in-part also why, we ain’t seen anything useful come of it. The environment itself is built for people who are ok with not sorting out the money launderers and human traffickers if problems emerge; indeed, if those sorts of problems can incapacitate their colleages as to help them make more money — well…. just don’t expect much of them, morally.\n\nSo, if a ‘capability’ came along and presented an opportunity to build works with integrity for moral progress; means to improve equity & peace globally; an underlying issue is that it will have enemies; & is dangerous work to do.\n\nTherefore; I think, what i’d focus on doing is producing 21st century towns; and using those environments as an incubation / R&D facility, to make future worlds. The point being, that the physical space is more controllable; and, depending on how its set-up, the means to control the comms is improved.\n\nI think; the ability to protect ‘good work’ from bad actors, is pretty much made impossible today. There’s so much designed to benefit bad actors, and its complex. Similar to illegal drugs, its not the refugees who have a capacity to import vast quantities; that’s just who people use at the end of the supply chain, knowing their people most likely to be discrminated against / to go to prison; therein, by implicit alliance — also benefit those who its suggested we ‘should trust’… who are other people, with extremely sophistocated capabilites that no-one ever hears or knows about; the most dangerous ones.\n\nTherefore; the point of making ‘towns’, as the best solution, is that it would be to way to start fairly fresh; build entirely new communities that reconsider the otherwise unaddressible underlying systemic problems.\n\n> In a way, its a bit like an defence base or embassy; or even in some ways, like the older pre-web traditions around how university communities work… but, this is a particular sort of environment, that, IMO, has special needs…\n\n-   Build a place, where housing / buildings, are completely reimagined.\n-   A place where the distribution and use of containers & packaging, completely reimagined\n-   A place, where the means through which the needs of girls & boys (women & men) are completely re-imagined; not to support the commodification of women, but rather,\n\n> To completely reorganise how members of our human family are empowered to grow, develop and due to the ramifications of STEAM outcomes — empowered to thrive, with it.\n\nI would seek out the ‘forgotten luminaries’, not the famous ones…\n\n> The people who, behind the scenes, have actually been doing the work, not for fame, not for fortune (although, this should not be stripped from them); but rather, because they sought to employ their time in this world, to better the world for others, around them.\n\nThe means to invest in those who today, without a safe environment to build a moral economy, are failing, at ‘risk of suicide’, those who are devoted to a moral pathway of growth; that should be, internationally understandable…\n\nI would build that ‘[knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics/humancentricwebecosystems/home)’ infrastructure i’ve spoken about so much; but, i’d look to augment how its all made to work and evolve, with practice; to be applied to address some of the enormous problems, some of the major opportunities we have, our world has, to improve our biosphere, our planet.\n\nI’d build socio-economic systems, that provide support for a liberalised meritocracy. An abilty to track and link what people do, how we build upon each-others works; whilst dismantling historical wrongs built into how that is presently expected to work, as though factory workers have rights and knowledge workers, be-deemed slaves.\n\nI’d build environments that are interwoven with technology, in ways that enhance how it is we work with our biosphere; rather than seeking to replace natural systems, with licensable alternatives.\n\nI’d seek to form a fabric that explores ‘moral grammar’, and i’d do so; somewhere, where the ability to enjoy our world, life; to learn from others, is encouraged — not because its part of a specified position at a desk, but rather, because its part of a broader ecosystem that’s about the growth of knowledge capital.\n\n> Underneath all things, is knowledge capital. The ability to address, attenuate, respond and, in a timely manner; do what be deemed ‘intelligent’, when faced with whatever it is that is presented for a decision.\n\nI’d build new advanced manufacture industries, i’d put ‘capital’ (or moreover, available labour) towards the growth of infrastructure projects never before thought possible; long before, i’d support a distribution of mankind, to mars.\n\nI’d look to how to turn deserts into forests, i’d look to create entirely different economic models that look to adjust how it is we think about energy and the lifecycle calculations linked to how we obtain it, how we use it, our universe.\n\nI’d build a self-sustaining infrastructure ecosystem; that’s built in our real-world, that empowers the world around it a means to reinvent democracies.\n\nThere are so many problems in our world, where the reason why we can’t address that problem, the reason why we can’t deploy solutions to those problems; is built upon the ‘bullshit’, or as some call it, the ‘shit-fuckery’. I’d go about building infrastructure to show our ‘leaders’, why, that’s a bad choice.\n\n> This ‘brain rape’ culture, that myopically believe ‘if they deconstruct the values’, that are common throughout our world regardless of how it is they denote their concept of ‘god’ in different books on different rocks; if they strip that to pieces to grab another piece of profit, thats good, for their kids…\n\nThe problem is about whether or not ‘we can’ its about scale, and culture.\n\nThere’s a bunch of modelling that’s not being done, about how to form apparatus we need to improve our capacity to promote peace & growth.\n\n_This is not a technological problem, its an ideological problem._\n\n> _If the right sort of environment is built; the means to create more value than the cost of its parts, should be a fairly straight-forward caculation._\n\nIndeed, _i think;_ the value represented by the state of california in its impacts, globally, would pale by comparison to what a solution to build solutions that can scale in a decentralised way to improve our capacity to build upon each-others work.\n\n> The problem that’s been brought about; is not something that they didn’t have a capacity to address a decade or more ago; the problem is that they were aware of the availability of these sorts of choices, and made the decision not to build the tools for us, in a way that we need to protect our human agency, our personhood, our environment, our children, our democracies and more than anything else; our ability to take our problems through our system of justice to seek lawful remedy for harms set upon us.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to describe what sort of thing i’m talking about, is illustrated in the show ‘Eureka’, takes a while, but lots of inspiration, seemingly originating from California… now, so many years ago…\n\n[**A Town Called Eureka - Google Search**  \n_In the years since World War II, the U.S. government has been relocating the world's geniuses (and their families) to…_g.co](https://g.co/kgs/wJBfqN \"https://g.co/kgs/wJBfqN\")[](https://g.co/kgs/wJBfqN)\n\nIf our western liberalised democracies want to subvert a pre-text, leading to circumstances of an entirely unsustainable nature across multiple areas; to somewhere else; my thinking is its worth thinking about how to do it.\n\nIts worth thinking about how to work with others, to progress peace; more than war, the advancement of ICT has brought with it the ability to have a war, without saying its a war.\n\nThis denies those who were involved, and the fallen, memorial, their children, respect, reverance, thanks and dignity. This problem has been put upon the world.\n\nI am unsure how those who have elected to do so, should seek forgiveness.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*43y6bUB4rO2hrMJHBTbxCA.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cia/status/1130938450226630657)\n\nOur leaders, in our societies, are building problems that put enormous burdens upon children of today; and their children, into the future. This is a choice. This is a choice that is built upon a lack of moral fortitude & fear.\n\nWe can do something about it, but the solution cannot & will not be _stolen_. Presently, a globally organised group are seeking to build infrastructure that may ensure no one will be able to tell the difference between just & wrong.\n\nThe underlying nature of what’s at play; is natural, by nature; it is still made.\n\nDRAFT: 25th April 2021 — Version 0.01."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/WebCivics Medium Posts/Knowledge Clouds/","title":"Knowledge Clouds"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### Objective\n\nThe objective purpose of this concept of a ‘knowledge clouds’ web-platform, is to create a user-story, ‘use-case’ investigation tool that supports the means to deliver a multifaceted linked knowledge cloud about any particular problem, using ontological design support principles.\n\nA related idea is well illustrated by this ResearchSpace Video:\n\n[ResearchSpace](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchspace.org&v=MaAv0SE7wis&redir_token=AswvxHPPsr1HNpqqHGq1nWN1HfN8MTU2NTY1NTc1M0AxNTY1NTY5MzUz&event=video_description) [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaAv0SE7wis)\n\n### Rationale\n\nFor the first iteration of this tool; The goal is to support multifaceted & complex knowledge representation with respect to the introduction of new business systems that have widespread repercussions.\n\nTo illustrate the type of complex project i’m thinking about — i’ll review, in-part, the [implications of introducing strong identity (KYCC/AML)](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0) and [(micro)payment infrastructure](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b) for the web; due in particular to the announced intent to form a viable ‘go to market’ strategy, supporting a multi-tenanted, multi-stakeholder approach to the introduction of Libra, and ecosystem solutions that are similar to its ecosystems offering.\n\n> Libra (or libra association) is an international association of global organisations who are working together to form, produce and deliver a financial solution for the web. The partners can be found [https://libra.org/en-US/association/#founding_members](https://libra.org/en-US/association/#founding_members) noting in particular, that they include (but is not limited to) MasterCard, Visa, Paypal, Stripe, Ebay, Lyft, Uber, Facebook and Vodafone.\n\n> It is expected that their solution will become easily incorporated into webpages through such means as a ‘log in with facebook’ button, or similar; and that the involved parties will continue to grow, whilst competitive solutions are forecast to appear as the underlying barriers are resolved by Libra, who in-turn obtain the early mover advantage.\n\n> Notes are being made in the libra forum, linked via this central post: [https://community.libra.org/t/micropayments-knowledge-economy-related-considerations/732/5](https://community.libra.org/t/micropayments-knowledge-economy-related-considerations/732/5)\n\nThe impact of these works are envisaged to be as instrumental to the future of humanity, as the introduction of the first financial accounting systems used by the templars and through the use of those first steps, the evolution of our existing financial instruments; that now need to be supplemented by tools made for the web. This brings about a need to create ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ infrastructure, which in-turn leads to project activities that is harder to do, than would otherwise be the case for projects using existing ‘status quo’ tools.\n\nThe opportunities / problems brought about, is expected to be more significant than the introduction of internet and/or Smart-Phones.\n\n> Traditional Media works can be described as being reliant upon three C’s, Content, Cash and Customers. Yet this model [is now fairly broken](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-an-au-newstart-might-mean-a-tv-license-as-to-fund-the-fix-for-our-creative-sector-economy-380b02b8b60a).\n\nNowThereafter; The instrumental components to any sovereign state may be defined as the new 3 C’’s\n\n1.  Citizenship / Personhood — starting with a birth certificate\n2.  Currency — AUD and similar, nowadays supported by the federal reserve system, etc.\n3.  Contracts / Law — that may associate to international ‘choice of law’, domestic law, or otherwise.\n\nThe purpose of defining this ‘knowledge cloud’ solution is to produce and operate a tool that is able to be used to explore the use-case factors that are affected by the introduction of new financial instruments and support the means for multiple stakeholder groups (and individuals) to analyse and respond to emerging issues and opportunities now therefore, brought about.\n\n### METHODOLOGY\n\nThe methodology sought to be employed by this application design project forms what I’ve called ‘knowledge clouds’ which provide a multifaceted means to investigate a particular solutions framework, incorporating the available knowledge of implications that relate to that particular process or thing.\n\nThis methodology is in-turn developed using a user-story process, where use-cases are identified within that user-story; and through the development of response materials for each use-case; a knowledge cloud is produced.\n\nThe theory is not unlike that of Ted Nelson’s Xanadu.\n\nThe utility of this ‘linked’ framework is, for my illustrated purpose, is different to the ‘document’ example provided by ted. Yet, the principles he (and those such as TimBL) use are instrumental to how it is i’m suggesting we could define a framework for ‘knowledge discovery & management; as built tools that help multi-tenanted — work-flow frameworks; to better support rapid curation & production, of complex project / systems, that incorporate cross-functional & inter-related dependencies.\n\n### What is a User story?\n\nA User-Story is an example of an activity that may be performed. These user-stories then in-turn involve other objects, things, people and groups; alongside a set of steps that are involved from beginning to end.\n\n### What is a Use-case?\n\nUser stories involve a one or many use-cases. Each use-case has a group of requirements that must be met in-order for that piece of the user-story to be carried out.\n\n### What is a Knowledge Cloud? (in this context)\n\nA knowledge cloud is a database that incorporates a group of user-stories, use-cases and related underlying decision making support material that aids in investigating a series of tasks and/or problems in relation to the delivery of an outcome that has an object purpose; and requires an array of considerations to be made in-order to successfully deliver an outcome that works in a ‘fit for purpose’ manner.\n\n#### The Technical Solution\n\nThe solution sought to be developed is a web based tool that provides an array of forms that are able to be filled out and submitted by contributors.\n\nThese forms build a graph database that does in-turn produce a vocabulary that can be referenced by other use-cases. The site will allow a particular user-story to be explored in a multifaceted way; such as to support the means to investigate a user-story (use-case/s) from different aspects in relation to the fulfilment of a solution that is able to provide key problems, available remedy. The Project / website will be developed using an iterative approach as to produce something that works relatively quickly; whilst being cognisant that the development project will continue to improve upon the work.\n\n**Key Functional Components to the Web Solution**\n\nAbility to:\n\n-   Log-In, Authenticate, be assigned permissions in relation to web-content\n-   Provide means to self-identify key attributes of user (location, role, skill-set, etc.)\n-   Create a user-story or use-case. Each of these objects are called ‘knowledge objects’.\n-   Provide each knowledge object an ID.\n-   Associate key concepts with structured vocabulary\n-   Ability to support faceted search for content on the site.\n-   Ability to download in PDF format the entire log of a ‘knowledge cloud’ about a topic.\n-   Ability to upload documents in pre-defined standardised formats (ie: Google Docs, MSWord, PDF, etc.)\n-   Ability to reference links, and for those links to be notated with intended purpose.\n-   A Functional Capacity where a ‘snapshot’ of the link is generated and stored in the database using Archive.org\n\n**KYCC / AML — Law Enforcement capabilities**\n\nAs has been further illustrated in my article ‘[Comms & Security: Privacy vs. Dignity](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0)’ a constituent consideration is about how to manage permissive use.\n\n#### USE-CASE\n\nIn order to preserve an environment of safety for citizens, accountability frameworks must technically be in place as to support identification and response for law enforcement (& citizens) in response to crime.\n\nThe purpose of providing protection from crime is to support the interests of citizens, as defined by law.\n\n#### PROBLEM\n\nMicropayments may be abused in a manner that could make use of thousands of accounts to pay an accumulative financial sum to a 3rd party for something they may do or provide illegally to others, including but not exclusive to circumstances where this incorporates the use of ‘mules’ or 3rd parties to mask the actors.\n\n#### AREA OF ENQUIRY / POSSIBLE SOLUTION\n\nFacebook, Ebay and other members already operate sophisticated Graph Database technology that is linking social activities between people and things (places, events, devices, etc.). Today, this is used to improve the presentation of computer generated recommendations, whether they be for advertising or discovery of things the user may be interested in reading or buying.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n-   What is the energy cost for performing this enquiry method, and what is the ‘cost of sale’ for performing the computations involved.\n-   As KYCC/AML is performed, the means to associate multiple devices with a single beneficial owner is part of what could be achieved systematically, as to rationalise the problem; Yet this in-turn also relates to law-enforcement,\n-   so how do these issues translate jurisdictionally for those whose role it is to protect their people.\n\n#### Economic Records & Knowledge Storage\n\nWhilst the concept of financial data has been discussed, perhaps this is an over simplification?\n\nEconomic Records incorporate identity related records & credentials, alongside both the financial IOUs and the related information; such as to include, digital receipts, transaction histories; and the means to associate Tax, Banking and related IDs.\n\n**USE CASE 1: Retail**\n\n-   A person goes to buy food from a take-away shop\n-   A person Goes to buy good from a groceries shop\n-   A person buys fuel for a vehicle they use in connection to work.\n-   A person buys stationary supplies for school/work\n-   A person pays their psychiatrist or gynaecologist for services rendered and needs to save the payment information to obtain a refund benefit from their health insurer or government.\n\n### Use Case 2: Income related records\n\nA person finds online jobs to do, that are funded by others who collectively produce a fund to distribute to others who perform labour services to achieve the delivery of a particular task; alone or in a group.\n\nSkills may be required for them to seek to be employed to do the job (ie: plumber).\n\nCredentials may be required to ensure they’re reasonably trusted to do the job (ie: child safety check, Criminal History Check, Trade Credential, right of employment (visa / nationality), etc.)\n\nThe consumer (account holder) may need to undertake accounting for income, and make payments for tax and related purposes. If subject to a 3rd party requirements (ie: GOV: social security, Child Support, etc. Insurance: Income Protection, etc.) they may be required to provide government information about their work, income, and perhaps also information about the resources used to do the job (ie: No.# KM’s travelled in Vehicle).\n\n#### AREA OF ENQUIRY / POSSIBLE SOLUTION\n\nWho stores these records? Under what ‘choice of law’ are they stored on behalf of the account holder online, and upon what terms.\n\n### USER STORIES\n\nBelow are some example ‘user stories’ that illustrate an idea that has an express ‘moral’ substance to its intended purpose and the sort of ‘vision’ that may be initially produced, as to investigate how the user-story may be made to work; and in-turn, how that user-story may be iteratively developed overtime to be supported by way of an implemented functional socioeconomically supported ecosystem solution.\n\n### USER STORY 1: ‘Lets go Fix problems caused by man in our Environment’\n\nTim is aware of Victorian Bushlands, in an area used for gold mining about a hundred years ago, where the rivers and general environment continues to be contaminated by an enormous amount of introduced species (flora in particular, but also fauna) that;\n\n-   Cause harm to the environment on a continual basis\n-   Make the areas less attractive to native Fauna and flora\n-   Play an instrumental role in severe fire events whether they be caused by extreme weather, or by man.\n\nResearch shows that the manner in which the fuel-loads were managed prior to the gold mining era was by way of an indigenous Australian practice known as ‘cool burning’, which isn’t a practical solution to manage the issue of the impact these introduced species have on the environment.\n\nWhereas Fire is a natural part of the Australian Landscape (indeed some species only reproduce as a consequence of fire); the impact of these introduced species is a type of fire that is provided an enormous amount of additional materials, and the means to support fire elevating up into the eucalyptus canopy, which produced a fire-storm outcome that is inescapable, unsurvivable for native fauna; threatening life, property and the sustainability of our natural world inclusive of its means to sustain others, through its role.\n\nThis problem has existed for many decades without response due to a lack of available economic means to address the problem by assigning labour of men & women to go out and remove the unwanted material. In addition to the cost of time / effort by people in the forest, those doing the work will need shelter and a method to provide supervisory support should others fund the cost without managing the work.\n\n#### SOCIO-ECONOMIC SOLUTIONS FRAMEWORK\n\nA Facebook ‘cause’ page is put together online, incorporating functional tools to support the creation and communication of a financial forecast and economic model for how this problem might be addressed.\n\nThe intention of the facebook ‘cause’ page is to resource workers and funds to get the job done. The undertaking needs no new company specifically, as the online system distributes funds / responsibilities to those involved using online economic tooling.\n\nThe system incorporates an environmental accounting standards innovation practice as a project partner, who are committed to articulating credentials in relation to a set of requirements that are put upon the projects governance practice method.\n\nWorkers are required to have an Australian Tax ID, and some are travellers (back-packers) who would ordinarily be working on farms collecting produce but are supported by Gov Policy for this type of work.\n\nPortable housing and transportation is organised in conjunction with an on-site project management practice, alongside fishing rods and other recreational activity support apparatus that forms part of the project expenses. The Backpackers require a credential to show that they’ve spent a certain amount of time doing this sort of work, as to extend their visa in Australia for an additional years stay.\n\nInsurance and safety plans are required, which are coordinated in association to local government of the area, who are supportive of the project in the hope it will improve the tourism revenue brought to the area.\n\nThe project has been formulated in a manner that is now able to articulate an underlying cost-assumption for the delivery of works, and a set of project governance practices have been elected, such as taking photos of the work done each day in addition to the public authoring of a work-diary, as to support the means for financial contributors who have collectively acted to make the work occur to see the product of their collective contributions.\n\nThe Facebook page is distributed to specialised groups and individuals using the facebook advertising tool which allows the opportunity to be communicated to people who might be interested, both in nearby towns, suburbs and cities; in addition to international entities who may work philanthropically to fund these sorts of projects. The total amount to be raised is identified (perhaps with an underwriter who may have a contingency plan if the projected cost is not enough); and people are invited to provide anything from less than a cent, through to whatever their nominated amount is (or the highest amount able to be provided via the web-system online, ie: perhaps $9995 AUD or sub $10,000 due to GOV regulations).\n\nThose who contribute are provided ‘online badges’ that provide to them a verifiable claim that they’ve supported that particular project (incorporating semantic definitions about its purpose, category, etc.) and can decide how they want that to be represented anywhere on the web on an unofficial or official basis.\n\nOther companies and groups are able to contribute also (noting — perhaps this is a ‘tax deductible gift’, and if so — what would be needed to support this determination and attribution, online) and be provided the accounting materials they need for financial reporting; alongside the supply of ‘online badges’, logos and branding materials that support their means to obtain ‘brand equity’ in relation to their sponsorship.\n\nCumulatively the funds are raised to support the delivery of the project, and the means to manage the delivery of it is supported by the online economic platform structures that enable communities to get good things done.\n\nThis in-turn supports the creation of new employment opportunities that are made easier to due to reduced need to support ‘human resource acquisition’ costs and the ability for people to be encouraged to look to the world about what they might want to do that is good for the world, and be provided the online tools to go and get support they need to turn an idea of something good to do; to a paid job to get it done.\n\n#### Inference Related Considerations\n\nThe above example highlights an environmental problem, that like many others, has not been addressed and would ordinarily require a very specific group of relatively expensive agents (for specific actors) to go about doing the work involved in raising, forming and dimensioning a problem area before anything could be addressed in that area. Consequentially the reality is, that all too often this is why these problem remain for decades without the means to be addressed (save by means of slavery); and this one example, can be extended to others where significant funds are allocated towards projects that look to investigate why something has fallen into a state of disrepair, resulted in death, economic injury, or similar.\n\nAn example in Australia includes the issues relating to the Murray Darling basin river system; whereby, it is entirely possible that people local to the problem areas of that river system were in need of work; and could act to benefit themselves and the environment if an online socioeconomic framework was in place.\n\nThere is not a lack of jobs to do (“work”); there’s a lack of ways to pay people to do a job. Libra is an initiative that offers a means to very quickly respond to this enormous problem. All too often today, it is the thing that benefit our natural world, and humanity as part of it; that cannot find the funding. This is an incremental problem, as the problem only worsens as the risk continues to elevate on the basis that fewer and fewer examples can be found of how doing good for society, humanity and environment can be good for the socio-economic environment of the broader jurisdictional territory for its economic growth.\n\n**SOME QUESTIONS & CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\n-   What are the use-cases built into that description above.\n-   Who are the involved parties that become curated through this online socio-economic system.\n-   How can these systems be improved overtime and what should be expected by parties interested in contributing towards the realisation of such a system, to be ‘early adopter issues’.\n\n### User Story 2: Lets improve the way we address, homelessness.\n\nSee Background Work: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kWJhmbHKxaS0uPLiUaN5zG8MZPcKUosj--WBSBbP5U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kWJhmbHKxaS0uPLiUaN5zG8MZPcKUosj--WBSBbP5U/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Considerations.**\n\nWhether it be electronic vouchers, the means for people to write a diary about what is happening in their life which may in-turn infer and educate others socially, about the sorts of things they struggle with, the things that they may have done well in the past; and the sorts of things that could instrumentally change their lives for the better.

This and many other workforce changes, that now sees the introduction of a ‘gig economy’ as is now part of new types of ‘[temporary work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_work)’ that hazards to strip away protections of the past; yet in all too many cases, useful work, particularly online is now unpaid.\n\nAnother problematic quality is that statistics relating to unemployment in the 1950’s-70’s related to a very different workforce environment. Those that were categorised as ‘employed’ (in some way) more likely fit into traditional labour hire frameworks; such as ‘casual’, ‘part-time’ and moreover ‘fulltime’ employment types, that were with a sole employer. This was in-turn associated to workers rights and obligations, that supported our needs.\n\nToday, as may be considered both in terms of statistics from the USA and Australia, whilst the statement of unemployment is still high the other problem is that these statistics are not likely fully disclosing the implications of new types of work, as a person who works a few hours — it could be said, is part of the statistically relevant group shown to be ‘employed’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GBJFrBXH99CZtIgWoQidLQ.png)\n\nSource: [Whitehouse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/americas-unemployment-rate-falls-lowest-level-almost-50-years/)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*47Sq-dYC4LrFQ1w-aodysA.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/australia-jobs-report-september-2018-10)\n\nImplicitly, i am drawing an association between the growth of advanced global telecommunications services, a set of troubling yet fixable lack of modern economic tooling & the problems shown as ‘economic debt’.\n\nWhen looking at how to link acts of ‘work’ with the concept of ‘gainful employment’; one of the older resources i found was noted in relation to the [work on webcredits](https://web.archive.org/web/20131020125735/http://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/wiki/Web_Credits) (now some years ago).\n\nImplicitly, the problem is that if you have a percentage of the ‘working age’ population at around 5% who are not earning an income (and then add to that children and the elderly); then there’s expenses incurred whether a society cares for their needs or not.\n\nWhilst the numbers are likely to be higher, some ways institutions have tried to address this issue is by hiring more people who are paid to care for those who are isolated from a gainful wage. This practice can become nonsensical as it may lead to unintended consequences of a workforce who require others to live in poverty as to justify their own wage; alongside other issues of economic inefficiency, poverty and at times — the worst of moral poverties.\n\nIn the industrial era, people were able to make things and if someone wanted them they could buy them from whoever made them. The means to defend producers from bad actors who sought to steal work derivatives, was relatively easy to seek, as to obtain lawful remedy.\n\n> This is not the case with work done online.\n\nThe other distinction between new types of work and the old, was that the means to form an economic ecosystem of transactions moreover related to few parties. If someone wants to buy something from a shop, the purchaser and seller are fairly easily identified. The product cost x, and x is provided to obtain the product.\n\n> This isn’t the only way it can work for trade, online.\n\nThere is an opportunity to support both the recognition of a workers contributions online, as well as the means to articulate the beneficial use of their works consumed by others online; if micropayment standards emerged.\n\nThe amount any one person may pay, might be a fraction of a cent. But when this is accumulatively considered in relation to many beneficiaries; the ability to use micropayments as a means to articulate economic trade for knowledge assets & equity, brings about a means to better rationalise the role of economy, in association to its means to support human activity, and the middle class.\n\nAn [OECD Publication on Knowledge Based Asset growth](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) reflects somewhat clearly the complete lack of participation by natural persons.\n\nIf we are to mend our economies and the means of them to support our capacity to resolve problems in reality, in our real-world; this underlying economic problem needs to be properly addressed, as a foundational requirement. The opportunity to do so has been around for a while, but it’s just not been adequately considered an important part of the agenda.\n\n> People who work for free, can only do so much…\n\nWhilst groups such as [Libra](https://libra.org) may offer the fastest path to bring to market real-world solutions that can be made to work; the future is in standards and new socio-economic tools decided by governments worldwide.\n\nWhilst not all payments should be micropayments, an important part of the financial instrument mix should be found if they were made to be included.\n\nIn many ways, the Web Advertising CPC/CPM systems are micropayments based. So, i’m not sure why it should be made so hard, to value human work.\n\nAn instrumental part of how this best be done should consider the very important design implications embodied as ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ and from my point of view, the broader merits of empowering a [human centric web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4).\n\nTherein, there are complex differences between a resource based economy, where the economic frameworks secure economic distribution based upon the means to produce and consume (natural world) resources; and what i’d call a ‘knowledge based economy’ where resources still need to be consumed, but that there’s improved means to assert value to human **work** activities, as to provide a means that can transit between the production of disposable resources as to support resource based trade; and something else,\n\n_that’s more about the merits of how people do things & the longer-term value that creates for others._\n\nOn an ethical basis, it’s about whether or not, what people do, matters."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/WebCivics Medium Posts/Open Data v3.0 Permissive Commons/","title":"Open Data v3.0 Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"_Why the open data movement needs a facelift, and how that might be done._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0HnyRBbZKPB_FVUvLAbNzQ.jpeg)\n\n**** ‘privacy vs. dignity’ and the nuances to be made between ‘open data’ and ‘permissive commons’ **** Image source: Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/IMissAustraliaGrewUpIn/](https://www.facebook.com/IMissAustraliaGrewUpIn/photos/a.227363927763383/650832355416536/?type=3&theater)\n\nThe open data movement is perhaps the most instrumental activity type, on the web, for the pursuit of humanitarian advancement. Without open-data, it would be hard to forge or foster, the means to make sense of anything.\n\nThe wikipedia entry for OpenData explains the concept in the following way;\n\n> [**Open data**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data#cite_note-1) The goals of the open-source data movement are similar to those of other “open(-source)” movements such as open-source [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement \"Open-source-software movement\"), [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware \"Open-source hardware\"), [open content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_content \"Open content\"), [open education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_education \"Open education\"), [open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources \"Open educational resources\"), [open government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_government \"Open government\"), [open knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge \"Open knowledge\"), [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_%28publishing%29 \"Open access (publishing)\"), [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science \"Open science\"), and the open web.\n\nIn many ways, the open-data movement sought to create an online equivalent to the availability of public libraries. Yet there are emergent problems, and opportunities — which brings about my considerations for how this instrumental movement might benefit from a facelift.\n\nTo distinguish between the two similar concepts, i introduce this concept of ‘permissive commons’.\n\nOpen data has been slowly uplifted to support software agents, as to support AI. These sorts of practices have been canvassed in an earlier post about [Tools that can help naturalise the web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) which in-turn relates also to my post about ‘[knowledge clouds](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9)’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dT5GV4fgqsuz_DH9KEnUDQ.png)\n\nPizza Ontology source: [Protege](https://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Protege4Pizzas10Minutes)\n\nIn someways, the considerations about ‘knowledge clouds’ could also be thought about in the form of knowledge trees & forests.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jJ-l1VhBiurHm7yZPHMNOg.jpeg)\n\n[Lod Cloud](https://lod-cloud.net/)\n\nTh Researchspace video below, illustrates these ‘knowledge clouds’ practice theory, in a manifest illustration of its meaningful utility for studies of history.\n\nThe difference between this ‘permissive commons’ approach and the research space illustration; is that permissive commons seeks to build these capacities into a _commons web,_ by using semantic web technologies in a particular way.\n\nThis distinct advantage brought about through the use of semantic web technologies and ecosystems; as apposed to other notation methods, is that works become both machine (AI) & human readable; and, if well designed, are able to be employ decentralised informatics outcomes, permissively.\n\nAnother way to visualise some components of how this works, can be visualised by testing out [mind-mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) software; whilst considering the opportunity to interlink maps or trees made in communities and other attributes such as temporal considerations are hard to see in a mind-map.\n\nA permissive commons approach is formed by defining Semantic ontologies.\n\n[Jason Silva: Shots of Awe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClYb9NpXnRemxYoWbcYANsA) — [What is Ontological Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aigR2UU4R20)?\n\nTherein; there is an important difference between the term [common](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/common) and [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons), in a similar way to the distinction between [civic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic) and [civics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civics), whilst both are important.\n\n> My work on Web Civics; is about fostering civilian participation WITH governments; rather than for government. Therein, “web civic” would be some sort of government owned thing, perhaps like a library, but web civics, is about fostering the importance role of civilians, citizens, to contribute. The idea being that practice of undertaking civics should be an inclusive practice with governments, the underlying context is that the role of citizens is important.\n\n> Without access to; and beneficial use of, knowledge, the means maintain [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood) and therefore the meaningful value of citizenship, is made mute.\n\nThe practice of commons or commoning as is distinct to ‘open’, considers the reality that most things (concepts, spaces, resources) are made permissively available to an intended group of people via means that incorporate custodial considerations to support the creation, governance and management of the common resources made to be part of a specified commons.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HQcbPdRHdXPMheX4b8Sf8w.png)\n\nIf we consider the role of ‘open data’ in association to the [DIKW Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid); then my explanation somewhat goes as follows,\n\n**Data** is bits of **information**, but not **information** itself. **Information** is in-essence, refined forms of data, made to be helpful to understand the some intended meaning.\n\nFake news, is information, but does not provide knowledge about the event or subject the fake news article talks about. **Knowledge** may be defined as relevant and objective **information** that helps in drawing conclusions (about the real world).\n\nThe purpose of improving upon the concept of ‘open data’ to ‘permissive commons’ in-effect seeks to forge a foundry for human activities to be put to the task of forging commons knowledge services that are able to be relied upon by other [agents](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent); ideally, in a ‘human centric’ approach, which would make other ‘artificial agents’ (software agents, company agents) servants of natural agents, and groups forged by natural agents as is made representative.\n\n> whilst noting the means to do so, would likely be best carried out using permissive commons, that in-turn provide support to form and maintain contracts online, and some existing work such as [creative commons](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_RDF), illustrates works in the field\n\n**Historical examples of commons**\n\nOlder (real-world) examples might make this easier to understand.\n\nFor example;\n\n**Farmers**\n\na group of farmers may cooperatively bring about the availability of a processing plant or storage facility for shared use as a commons facility. Yet this infrastructure is not intended to be entirely ‘free’, the facility has a governance framework and a group of intended beneficiaries,\n\nAs such, if some entrepreneur wanted to import competing resources to store in these facilities at the expense of farmers — that would not be allowed.\n\n**Yacht Club**\n\nSimilarly, a yacht-club might have a yard and a crane to help take a boat in and out of the water, and to make repairs; but it’s not able to be used to pull a motor out of vehicle or some other unintended purpose.\n\n> Therein — whilst many things are beneficially ‘commons’, their not “freely available to everyone to use and republish (or repurpose) as they wish”\n\nThe second issue is that of economic governance.\n\nWhilst many prefer the fantasy that things on the internet are truely free, this idea has no reliable foundation in reality. From the energy consumed to make computers work, to the resources invested in the manufacture of devices inter-networked on the web; and perhaps more importantly than most consider, the cost of life, as has been incurred by those who do some sort of work to foster growth both of the resources available on the web, and the means of online works to positively impact something that belongs to our biosphere, in some way (not always)…\n\n> Free, doesn’t actually exist. Without attribution, workers making things for ‘free’ are actually paying themselves to do something, without acknowledgement.\n\nWhilst this sort of framework has played a significant role for the creation of many good things; it is also instrumentally responsible for a great deal of bad and sometimes unintended outcomes.\n\nThe worst examples are those that show how this manifest well accepted practice of ‘web slavery’ has in-effect been weaponised as a cyber warfare tool.\n\nThereafter; Considerations of how ‘open data’ has been deployed shows that in reality there are actually very few known ‘_trusted_’ (whether trust-worthy or not) domain-name based sources (and underlying company structures) who are now the international gatekeepers to the [bewildering store of (human) knowledge](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/). This is in-turn considered to have some form of meaningful relationship between the relatively misleading concept defined as ‘open data’, and what may be improved upon as ‘permissive commons’, as to attach semantics relating to informatics and progress towards a knowledge age.\n\nWhereas; in todays ‘open data’ movement powering the ‘information age’,\n\n-   Whilst some websites aren’t very good due to a lack of available funding; and\n-   others continually make requests for donations; whilst a handful of others,\n-   act to support as beneficiaries; the largest corporations in the world.\n\n_The greatest beneficiaries of the well-intended and vitally important ‘open data movement’ is this handful companies, who positioned themselves as the communications and knowledge gatekeepers._\n\nHaving forged ‘golden handcuffs’ by owning the search-box, or a persons address book; these multi-billion dollar companies are now all too often associated with gainful incomes associated to nefarious actors and the ‘information’ they peddle for money that includes; fake news, spam and a great deal more. Making matters worse, the ontological vocabularies most used on the internet today refer to object definitions of well known words for specified purpose as to sell things.\n\nThe easiest way to example this, is how the system used by search giants; Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Yandex, etc. defines such things as a Physician.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BqPiHOLrtZjc256ClSu5gA.png)\n\n[https://schema.org/Physician](https://schema.org/Physician)\n\n[schemaorg](https://schema.org/) to populate search results and support the growth and development of AI, defines the term [Physician](https://schema.org/Physician) as a place, rather than person or profession.\n\n_Whilst it is understandably the case that the reason why this occurs is that the purpose of this vocabulary (which may be repurposed for many other applications, by trained or untrained producers) is to assist with discovering information on maps — the ability to find a doctors office._\n\nThe other relatively well characterised issue is that these systems now lack the ability to identify objects about the world, that have no financial incentive to illustrate. As is otherwise illustrated below; it is now easier to find a toilet by searching for the nearest McDonalds restaurant, due to the lack of ontology.\n\n> This predicament influences the manifest nature of how Artificial Intelligence Agents (software agents) are made to (be able to) work.\n\nIf we have an informatics environment that are **_centrally governed, on an international basis_** supporting ‘sense making’ capacities for all _things_; then the means to support ‘privacy’ or moreover dignity, is entirely undermined.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZrtG6-3JVLQMco58twkQtw.png)\n\n[Diagram i’ve authored previously about human centric web ecosystems](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infosphere_actor_objects.svg) | In relation to my blog post on webizen re: [SOCIO-ECONOMIC RELATIONS | A CONCEPTUAL MODEL](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/socioeconomic-relations-p1/)\n\n> As a consequence of my design considerations towards the manifestation of a [human centric web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4); one of the important functional requirement is the need to reliably obtain ‘commons’ informatics (data/information/knowledge) that can then be locally consumed in relation to the means for a machine-processed query (ie: AI function) to have the informatics-resources it needs available to it, to perform its basic functions, privately.\n\nThe alternative used today is generally provided as a domain based API, but this means the capacity to perform the query privacy is dependent upon them.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k0s8Efc1koWELEcEJpcbgA.jpeg)\n\nsource: reddit\n\nThe Open Data movement has brought about a somewhat exceptional ‘[open data charter](https://opendatacharter.net/)’ that provides a set of objective needs that are _of most importance_ for society via the lens of open data. My thoughts on permissive commons seek to uplift the spirit of these principles, as to support the manufacture of improved apparatus, as to put them to better use.\n\nWhilst it is ‘common sense’ that the principle of instrumental importance is the need to ensure read permissions (mostly) stay open; i’ll have to explain why i say ‘mostly’ and not always, in consideration of the fact that not-everyone needs to know everything; but this in-turn causes a ripple effect.\n\n**Introducing Permissive Commons: a technical architecture overview**\n\nBreaking down the parts, i’ll make some high-level notes about what i mean by permissive, and implicitly therein permissions; methods to support discoverability, decentralisation and custodianship. Whilst this methodology is designed to support the way systems work today; it’s also, and perhaps more importantly considering future needs, which i’ll briefly review also\n\n**1. Permissions to support permissive use.**\n\nPermissions from a perspective of technical apparatus; refers to the means for an agent to create, edit, read and append informatics resources or part of them. Commonly linked to the concept of [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (create, read, update, delete); permissioning systems offer a means to distinguish roles in relation to informatics resources. Another way of looking at permissions in a networked environment; is the idea of Attribute-based Access Control.\n\nIf this is considered in the context of systems that support version control, such as Git (as is distinct to Github); counterpart qualities brought about include; the ability to,\n\n-   To target a specific version by a specified publisher / authority\n-   ‘fork’ a version, update, make changes and re:publish as an alternate publisher / authority\n-   Curate versions between authorities as coupled or decoupled resources\n-   Reference related resources, for inferencing solutions, whilst retaining resolution of provenance and trust related semantic qualities.\n\nThis series of permission related considerations are important for supporting means to append, support versions and linked assets that are made to be connected to the original ‘piece’ of data that is not generically associated to ‘open data’ solutions today. A way this can be illustrated through the lens of documents; is in-turn, the subject of a life-long field of work by [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson).\n\nXanadu Space by Ted Nelson\n\nThe video by Ted illustrates the relationships between pieces of knowledge, fairly well. Yet therein, the way this is managed is through some form of authentication. The vast majority of web-use is now performed with the support of a few types of authentication, whilst the operational consumption of online material is not connected to a natural persons identity (at least not in a way that’s there for all to see).\n\n> Not everyone, needs to know everything\n\nIn the vast majority of use-cases, ‘Open’ read permissions are amongst the most important qualities that are required to uplift ‘open data’ intents; and any potential means to deliver better formats, as is the intent of this ‘permissive commons’ theory. Therein; the means to maintain the capacity to identify how an interaction with something has been influenced by others — becomes somewhat essential for ‘sense making’ with cyber-commons resources, that are intended to support cyber-physical systems.\n\n[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)\n\n> It is also important to consider the differentiated means for ‘sense making’ between those who do not have permission; and those who do. If a natural agent makes mistakes in reliance of the best available information they have available to them; this is very different to those how do the same, in a circumstance where it is clearly known to them, reality shows otherwise.\n\n> Considering the effect of this overtime; as is instrumentally known as learning, the knowledge of all things develops overtime; both individually, socially and globally, as may relate to the knowledge of all mankind.\n\nTherein; one might consider use-cases that relate to health and medicine.\n\nThe health-sciences field today, has a well-established ecosystem of available ontologies; yet present means for patients to play a better role is made hard.\n\n**Social Sciences & Medical Research**\n\nWithin the concept of permissive commons, is the consideration that some agents (actors) may not need the point-data, which is the exacting audit ready, otherwise ‘open’ record that relates to the useful embodiment of some sort of dataset, information asset / knowledge.\n\nIf researchers are doing work attempting to address a critical medico-legal / societal issue; such as suicide, there’s a bunch of informatics about a persons life (and the end of it), alongside useful informatics about relations to others socially surrounding a case; that if collected, collated and summarised, as to be provided as an anonymised dataset for researchers, could make it possible for outcomes to be found where it would be otherwise impossible to do so.\n\nBut the implications of these sorts of things associates directly to privacy; or moreover dignity considerations that may well affect children amongst others.\n\nTo ensure research is being carried out upon real data, and not made-up circumstances that may better suit aversions to inconvenient facts; the underlying data does in-fact need to have a means to be audited. An Audit function could be supported by a nominated authorised agent or agency, who could be equipped to support auditing services — much like an Accountant.\n\n_This process does not need to be public or made globally (or locally) centralised._\n\n> Meanwhile; large ‘data lakes’ (or knowledge banks) could aggregate informatics permissively from its customers as to generate anonymised summary results and insights; and/or, furnish means to act in a federated activity to perform specified queries across participant frameworks, privately; providing outputs as commons.\n\n> Similarly; specifically tailored agents could be produced to operate permissively with special interest groups; such as, people who suffer from a particular disease, ailment or health problem. Informatics could be curated for use by their medical clinicians, alongside derivative informatics products for researchers that are created by collating informatics via specified data-structures, from many people.\n\nIn other less sensitive areas of ‘open data’ policy; these types of practices are already readily used; Whether it be the availability of economic data or (almost) any other area of statistics, summaries are provided publicly; the underlying ‘point data’, not at all.\n\nYet a problem that today’s open-data movement hasn’t been able to resolve where it comes to analysis of social issues (for instance); is that the data collected can be from a relatively small study, as such the quality of the derivative materials become less reliable and is often also vexed with an array of other issues that relates to who did the study and for what purpose.\n\n**Cyber Knowledge Systems**\n\nThe issues that are exhibited in fields such as statistics or research; are both linked, yet seperate to those of how permissive commons may be used to help pizza shop owners sell pizzas they can make, on their own websites; or how, to produce accessibility to knowledge about our biosphere, flora, fauna and all sorts of things in it; alongside how to publish trusted information about where the local civic amenities are, as may be useful for people in the area.\n\nPermissions play a role in each case. The alternative of ‘open data’ from a lay perspective may be considered to suggest; that an agent can consume the open data provided by some authority, perhaps make changes to it to suit some form of agenda; and then republish it as an authoritative source.\n\n_It is not only troublesome in low-risk use-cases, but also dangerous in others._\n\nWithout the means to consume ‘knowledge’ or ‘information’, as does relate to a series of social frameworks relating to trust rationale, data is data, open or otherwise; ‘open data’ is far less useful than socio-cyber solutions that can be put to use to build trust-frameworks for commons and real-world tasks.\n\n**2. Authorities: Group Agents & write, edit & append permissions**\n\n**Agent Identifiers**\n\nThe ability to create a record is something that all persons should reasonably be made able to do; both as expressed persons (meaning — real-names used) and through means of psuedo-anonymity; which is to say, whilst not everyone needs to know everything. There are also attack vectors employed through the use of fake accounts, and this is also an important issue to address.\n\n> Bad actors sully the means for others to make use of resources to be enriched.\n\nCurrently, there’s an array of ways that agent identifiers are created; yet most of these methods now poorly support the means to maintain hygiene online.\n\nIn a great many use-case examples relating to commons, there have traditionally been nominated custodians or stewards.\n\nOne way i try to explain this is by considering the processes involved in the creation of a Church, Library, [Mechanics Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics%27_Institutes) or University.\n\n_Stonemasons and such, would undertake the activity of building, the building._\n\nIt is most likely that they were paid for their labour to do so; but once their role in creating the civic infrastructure was done, the management of it was handed over to someone else.\n\n> Without a library, there would be no easy place to find or read a book; or in consideration of the concept more broadly; the means to learn, pray or live.\n\n> Those who made this infrastructure were not expected to extinguish their own lives for having done so; and, they were acknowledged for their works by some form made available for historical purposes if nothing else.\n\nIn consideration for how this associates to the concept of ‘write permissions’, the principle is that most forms of ‘commons’ has some form of custodianship framework. An example of the importance of this might be considered in relation to the use-case of making the discovery of public toilets available online where it is preferable that a means to ensure results are properly qualified.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BPC7fRRADXgVrRiKdscdyg.png)\n\nSearch result Aug 2016 for ‘public toilet’\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1JTVStIhYqjv_2bjDKmfhg.jpeg)\n\nThe Public Toilets example is similar in nature to that of the needs for programs such as [Neighborhood Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_watch), a community program that seeks to provide a social means to help people who need to find a safe place to go.\n\nIn both cases, it is important that the resources found online have the backing of a community based custodial to ensure safety for those who use the facility.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ct6vUfVrYeR375k0tKjmvA.png)\n\n[Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)\n\nWhat we developed in W3C Credentials CG was a set of tools that could be used to verify how one particular agent, such as a trusted institution, was able to make a set of statements that could in-turn be consumed by others as a series of trustworthy informatics resources; as required to support trustworthy, decision makers.\n\nTherein; the consideration of ‘permissive commons’ as distinct to ‘open data’, seeks to attend to the underlying reality that the way ‘commons’ are managed and made discoverable; does indeed relate to, a complex web of permissions that whilst indirectly considered in the somewhat misleading concept of ‘open data’; does in-fact relate to a set of supportively permissive practices. By refining the declarations of how this is (better) achieved, commons becomes more usefully available; and participatory engagement is in-turn encouraged.\n\n**3. Format**\n\n**3.1 Linked Data & URIs**\n\nThe practice method for publishing Permissive commons is best done by rendering resources in linked-data RDF related formats; with or without the use of DID based URIs.\n\nWhat are DID’s?\n\n[DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) technology is poorly documented as a consequence of intentional decision making practices brought about whilst the work was getting (funded) done. In-essence, the documentation today speaks of identity; whereas DIDs are also useful for supporting identified, entities; whereby (machine readable) statements are made with the use of cryptographic instruments.\n\n{  \n  \"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2019/did/v1\", \"https://w3id.org/security/v1\"],  \n  \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",  \n  ...  \n  \"publicKey\": [{  \n    \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1\",  \n    \"type\": \"RsaVerificationKey2018\",  \n    \"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",  \n    \"publicKeyPem\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\\r\\n\"  \n  }, {  \n    \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2\",  \n    \"type\": \"Ed25519VerificationKey2018\",  \n    \"controller\": \"did:example:pqrstuvwxyz0987654321\",  \n    \"publicKeyBase58\": \"H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV\"  \n  }, {  \n    \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-3\",  \n    \"type\": \"Secp256k1VerificationKey2018\",  \n    \"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",  \n    \"publicKeyHex\": \"02b97c30de767f084ce3080168ee293053ba33b235d7116a3263d29f1450936b71\"  \n  }],  \n  ...  \n}\n\n> note comments made in: [Comms & Security: privacy vs. dignity](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0) and The article ‘[tools that can help naturalise the web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3)’ goes into the mechanics of how this works in more detail.\n\nPart of the underlying requirements is to ensure resources are made available in a format that is addressable via a URI. DID’s provide a means to decentralise the custodianship of a URI as to decouple the authoritative source(s) from a traditional approach that would require a HTTP based URI.\n\n**3.2 Made for Decentralised use**\n\nThere are an array of DLT solutions that are becoming available (post blockchain, blockchain related tech) that include DHT methods amongst the many. Early W3C CG works uplifted MIT [HTTPA](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2010/Papers/IAB-privacy/httpa.pdf) works with [WebDHT](https://opencreds.org/specs/source/webdht/), whilst later works evolved to consider [WebLedger](https://w3c.github.io/web-ledger/) solutions. Whilst it is envisaged that standards will emerge in this particular area of protocol innovation; the underlying principle is that the storage framework should be able to support decentralised and therefore local use.\n\nThe easy explanation for lay people, is that it works kinda like a blockchain or torrent; in that, an announcer provides discovery for the information that is made downloadable, as to be able to make use of it locally.\n\nAmongst the best illustrations of solutions that have been made to work currently, is that which has been produced by the internet archive; called [dweb](https://dweb.archive.org/) ([source](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-archive)). dWeb implements the internet archive using [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) and [wolk](https://wolk.com/); whilst [gun.eco](https://gun.eco/) (a graphDB) and the [holochain protocol](https://holochain.org/) (as distinct to holo, the company, or commons engine as a holo related initiative) are amongst the notable protocol solutions DID technology tries to harmonise. I am not aware of any ‘standard’ (IETF presumably) protocol solution; although the topic has been explored for sometime via the [IRTF Information Centric Networking](https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/icnrg/about/) research group (IRTF is associated to IETF); and some components of the required solutions have been made IETF RFCs as a consequence of community group works facilitated by way of W3C-CGs.\n\nImportantly; the solutions that will work, need to support RDF or moreover; the principles underpinning semantic web ecosystems. Whilst DID documentation is in my mind, poorly produced; the solutions framework is intended to support otherwise not-updated semantic web documentation that moreover expressly refers to services provided solely, over HTTP.\n\n**3.3 Support for Version Control (Provenance & History)**\n\nThere are many use-cases where the versions of; and temporal notations of, a resource becomes important for the means and derivative insights brought about by its use.\n\nAs such; The considerations have a set of real-world implications in relation to law, but also many other things and practicalities.\n\nWhilst the continual improvement of knowledge is most certainly desirable, or moreover a ‘must have’, in terms of technical functional qualities; as it is likely to be the case that erroneous decisions may be made on the basis of false, misleading or bad data; the answer to this problem isn’t simply the means for the issue to be scrubbed from history (as to form a dissociative relationship to any implications). Relations naturally change overtime, intrinsically forming a form of temporal ontologically discernible quality, that by simply updating a singular record in a manner that makes the formerly relied upon version entirely unavailable, cannot support.\n\n> One reason why it is important, is that changes to URI sourced materials may in-fact substantially change its meaning, as may in-turn act to pervert sense making.\n\n> People have the right to change their minds; their position, on any given topic… Indeed moreover it’s expected of people who are considered to be reason-able.\n\nThe practice of learning implicitly relates & relies upon the capacities of a system, to support the notion of evolution of understandings, as to support the concept of understanding, as is employed improve upon prior _temporal_ states. In socially-applied informatics environments, the provenance of inter-related ‘ripple effects’ is of importance to relations denoted as observations (or ‘observers’) of other agents, who have at some time interacted with it.\n\n**4. Societal Custodial relations & Stewardship**\n\n(Data|Information | Knowledge) ‘Commons’ are essential tools to support means through which natural agents are made able to engender their own sense of wisdom, that may only then, become in-turn, a shared resource.\n\nIn the Natural world; this is often articulated via identified groups, such as is the case with a nations system of government. Therein; the articulation of laws in societies have a material and custodial relationship to Acts of Parliament; and thereafter, relationships to any judgements and common-law. Permissive commons as a cyber-physical toolset in-turn supports the means to extend the acts of real-world natural agents to support (and influnce) analysis practices. One example of this is that some of the permissive commons assets available, might be done to associate two otherwise foreign uses of similar terms, with some sense of discernible logic (ideally both machine and human readable, as may be achieved per point 3) as to support the means for others to comprehend such things as the differences between ‘copyright’ in one region, to the definition formed by laws in Another.\n\nAs such, one might imagine a time where the votes made by parliamentarians (and any notes that may relate to their vote) could be made in a digitally ‘minted’ format, that in-turn acts digitally to be a signatory to the introduction of that commons asset; and/or, the renewal of it. Yet also, thereafter, others may then in-turn form meaningful relations and inferences between those laws and considerations that are not necessarily ‘same as’ but ‘similar to’ others elsewhere; and in-turn, providing semantics explaining how & why.\n\nWhere the consideration relates, in-turn, to the practices of managing civic amenities; in countries such as Australia, it is the role of local government, otherwise known as councils or shires; whom by means of the Australian Constitution act as agents of state government to support the maintenance of these assets by way of tasks performed by employees of the local authority.\n\nMembers of the public are expressly invited to contribute or notify their local council if there is a problem; but, the ‘digital twin’ of the physical asset online, would be a permissive commons assets that is governed by the local council, and would most likely be governed through an integration with council systems, as to trigger updated information.\n\n> _An example may be that of vandalism, or closure for some reason._\n\n> But the manner in how these informatics objects that are ‘commons’ are managed; is reasonably considered to need an authority. The availability of the afore mentioned, toilets, or safe spaces — need authorities involved for safety.\n\nAnother example may be the rules that are set-out and publicly available for Augmented Reality Applications; to ensure virtual game objectives are not encouraging children to play on roads or freeways; or conversely, that perhaps ‘virtual boundaries’ are able to be set-around safe areas like parks, for AR Play.\n\nI envisage the means to create various constructs of ‘knowledge forests’ that interweave the voices of citizens, electronically; as resources for stewards to employ & be made accountable; as would relate to their roles of managing permissive commons. Semantic Web provides the sense-making linkages between informatics resources; DIDs help decentralise discovery and use, version control and permission systems help form trustworthy Semantics.\n\nTherein; the authoritative chains are not, by design, intended to be globally centralised in any practical way; rather, the employment of standards and emergent protocols enable the creation of societal systems to extend support for cyber-physical relations to conform to real-world [fiduciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary) relationships.\n\n**5. Artificial Intelligence**\n\nHBO Silicon Valley ‘not hotdog’\n\nPerhaps of most importance today, is the array of considerations brought about by the instrumental use of ‘data’ for software agents, or AI. The means to ensure the role & responsibility of parliamentarians, amongst others, has never before become so important, as is now the case, as required, to uplift the purposeful role of humanitarian tenure in any role; in an age where artificial intelligence systems are going to be of enormous influence.\n\n> The same consideration is made for all members of our human family; yet, it seems pointless if those consider themselves most importance as societal leaders, fail to understand how ‘taking the easy road’ may now poorly affect others in a way that is not the same as any human based systems framework, worked before.\n\n_I state it to be the case, clearly; that our information systems today do not support anonymity. As such; they are not able to fully support entirely private use. Indeed also, this principle is reasonably cemented in natural laws, as may be examined using science; in manners now significantly enhanced with social graph technology as to explore relationships between the means to discern inferences, and the effects of actions as is examined as formative interference patterns that have a direct and inferred relationship to causality._\n\nThe question that is brought about; is whether and how to make best use of the opportunity, to make something that supports the distribution and curation of knowledge apparatus, accessibility, and how it is to be managed.\n\nHow can we employ ICT strategies, to in-turn promote capacity that enriches usefully evolved bodies of knowledge, as to best support the notion of mandate; and, how can resources used, be considered trustworthy, by courts.\n\nSystems are reliant upon agreements internationally, how should permissive commons be made to work; for the betterment of all stakeholders involved.\n\nThe informatics systems that are being defined on way or another (but not necessarily as commons) is not solely about text or numeric data; but also, informatics structures that are used to discern aspects of reality in many ways.\n\nOne such way is rich-media, where the EU funded [Mico Project](http://mico-project.eu) made headway to standardise tools that could lead to services that could democratise the use of AI, for the analysis of rich media assets. The perceived value of this emergent field was illustrated by the US TV Show [Silicon Valley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/).\n\n> [See Mike Judge, co-creator of the HBO series Silicon Valley speak at the Decentralised Web Summit, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-5HXDOveGM).\n\nOne of the stories in this show illustrates a narrative about a computer vision tool that is first funded as a tool to identify food.\n\nHBO: Silicon Valley Season 4 Episode 4 ‘Seefood Technologies and ‘Not Hot Dog’\n\nWhat this illustrates; is that, no-matter whether or not any choices are made, the vast global silo’d infrastructure that is moreover converged into the community of california (and Californian law) have enormous data capabilities to see what is actually going on. These tools are applied to media online, and the derivative services made available via a proprietary API.\n\n> This does not best support the democratisation of AI\n\nThe decisions that can be made, in a business systems based vacuum. The alternative of ‘permissioned commons’ could limit and lesson means through which people are harmed; whether wilfully, negligently or due to practices of malfeasance; the factors that need to be addressed as to best respond to the issues brought about by ‘AI’ include factors or circumstances; that will otherwise lead to poor or false belief’s & statements. This pervasive problem is likely to in-turn influence public records, including those such as the [hansard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansard). So, there’s a question about the relationships between matters of fact, as are able to be assessed by someone due to the ever growing surveillance capabilities consumed as a raw resource, for AI. Importantly therein also, the availability of business systems to support work being done.\n\n> One way to address this problem is to form a [Micropayments Standards: An Economic Imperative for the Knowledge Age](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b), noting the practice of doing so is in-effect the same as the tactical process required for permissive commons.\n\nAI capabilities are usefully able to be employed; as to discern or make distinct, the means or comprehension, to distinguish between actors who are known to have known what; in relation to the commission of wrongdoings. This helps to discern intent in relation to a wrongful act, but only if it’s a supported function. To do so, my belief is in a knowledge banking industry, yet today this seems most likely to occur as a consequence of new projects by facebook or similar. Whilst the [Libra Association](https://libra.org/en-US/association/) couples the existing capacity of those such as facebook to update and improve upon its global graph; a globally democratised alternative, would require much more work to evolve.\n\nYet the principle capacity to discern the difference between someone who knew better, and those who were reasonably not able to know, critical and instrumental pieces of information; is able to be demonstrated by those such as facebook (and google), today. In relation to the use of these sorts of systems by AI agents, it is not simply about the means to understand what is known; but also what is not. Permissive commons is instrumental to forming a non-corporatised approach, to how this is facilitated for our natural world.\n\n**_Finally — AI & Intellectual property._**\n\nIn the show, Silicon Valley, it is later found that the ‘seefood technologies’ not hot dog app; is unable to identify any other food than hotdogs. It is then found to be best able to be repurposed for commercial purposes, to identify explicit materials online.\n\nHBO Silicon Valley ‘not hot dog’ app repurposed\n\nInternational trade is built upon the works of others that become protected by law by terms relating to Intellectual property. Whilst there could be a system that paid a nominal amount, such as $0.00001 every time something useful; is made use of, this capacity doesn’t exist in business systems online today.\n\n> The consequence is competition between subject matter experts, rather than being able to forge cooperative alliances working collaboratively towards the realisation of specified goals. Consequentially, we consume more energy, to form progress…\n\nPerhaps as a defensive tactic, there is a call [to recognize AI as an inventor.](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49191645)\n\n> I think more simply put, if you had a global company that was able to read and collate all the documents produced about innovative and potentially valuable ideas from all across the world; would you make a bot that directed key staff, partners and alliances towards an augmented & AI Curated experience that may help them get a patent on those ideas first?\n\nWould it be consistent with the principles of good corporate citizenship, to let foreigners have the opportunity to get those economic opportunities in place first? In the current ecosystems, unlike [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty), the answer is reasonably, no.\n\nGovernments could set-out a set of principles for Cyberspace, but today that doesn’t exist. I have registered ‘thecharter.eco’ but its an idea not a useful tool.\n\n> As part of a ‘permissive commons’ approach, it is entirely possible to deliver a set of ontological resources that consider our ecosphere and the impact cyber-physical systems have on all things real, as are part of our natural world.\n\n> I am interested in exploring this idea; and i hope others will be too…\n\n**6. Democracy, Citizenship & the role of Web Worker Rights**\n\nIn-order to make permissive commons work to best effect; the concept would require an international network of domestic systems of inter-governance.\n\nShould present infrastructure be better ‘democratised’, then the outcome could not only be the creation of ‘more jobs’; but also — improved means for the governance of nation built upon a system of democracy that grew from such concepts as ‘rule of law’.\n\nIn our internationally competitive environment, we have not yet applied considerations of how project frameworks like [BOT/DBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build%E2%80%93operate%E2%80%93transfer), or public-private partnerships, used to build the libraries of the past; could be used to address our means to attend to the importance of critical, cyber-social infrastructure, as is required by mankind. In my opinion, it would be enormously short-sighted, no-matter the difficulties involved in garnishing an effective basis for informed decision making, to not do so, as can be made, to be brought about.\n\n> The competition is not between the aristocrats and ‘old money’ tribes whose castles of wealth at times form adversarial interests to the common citizen;\n\n> Rather, this competition is arguably about the relevance of a nations government at all. Without domestic means to support sense making and therein mandate, cyber-physical systems threaten reemergence of old problems via cyber domains.\n\nThe competitive forces are international in nature, not local. In terms of trade, having the truth called out in secret overseas, is much worse than the cost of addressing the underlying issues on a domestic basis.\n\nThe implications to how why it is important to attend to these issues should be reasonably universally understood; as to positively impact the lives of children EVEN THOUGH, their family members may have a position of importance, publicly. This nature of ‘permissive commons’ gets to the heart of how it is we can meaningfully and purposefully produce tools, to support human dignity.\n\n_The most awesome way i’ve seen this explained; is this short video,_\n\nnew definition of a billionaire, “to positively impact the lives of a billion people”\n\n_Therein,_ [_Jason Silva_](https://www.thisisjasonsilva.com/) _ends his parable with the concept that the future definition of a billionaire, is a person who has positively impacted the lives of a billion people. With permissive commons, this is made far easier to achieve._\n\nPermissive commons is an instrumental part of how we may best create a modern innovative medium, for the [_bewildering store of knowledge_](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) that has been fostered as to become useful real-world knowledge assets, by mankind.\n\nThe way this can be funded, is through the meaningful use of micropayments, yet the implication of bringing about a means to pay people who do valuable work in areas that support the evolution of our shared commons, leads to a situation where we need to think about anti-money laundering laws, or KYCC/AML.\n\n> When associating reasonably tiny fractions of a cent that contributes towards a persons means to be paid a wage; until a reasonable amount has been garnished by that contributor (ie: ~$xx per hour), then the means to form a practice method where mankind is encouraged to invest in works for the betterment of our world; rather than alternatives such as fake news, [which are known to be of far more value to creators today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news_website#North_Macedonia).\n\n-   The ability to make use of the internet, is not truely free today.\n-   Civilians, are now considered in terms of their role as a [consumer to be protected](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DITC/CompetitionLaw/UN-Guidelines-on-Consumer-Protection.aspx); rather than as natural world tenants, companies _should_ serve..\n\nThe manifest converse reality is; that today, it’s their attention that’s being consumed as a resource, and that ‘open data’ frameworks have contributed to the drivers that now propagate many distinct fiction of reality; which are in-turn beneficially, complimentary to old ‘resource based economy’ method; pervasively employed to consume all natural resources, for (false) profits.\n\nAs a supplemental to the video above, Author [Shoshana Zuboff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff) in the video Age of Surveillance Capitalism: “We Thought We Were Searching Google, But Google Was Searching Us” illustrates her position on how the web works today.\n\nWhilst the underlying purported concept of ‘consumer’ doesn’t really apply, as the global platforms that are related to this concept don’t really have competitors, so as there’s no ‘choice’, its not really about market alternatives.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SOaVuHVuheFjVMcYu6f4-w.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranking-the-top-100-websites-in-the-world/)\n\n> If someone asks you to connect with them on facebook, you have to use facebook. If you leave facebook, you can’t take your ‘friends’ with you.\n\nSo, the concept of being a ‘consumer’ is not fit or proper, for many reasons.\n\n-   The customers of these sites are those who pay to display advertising. Therein, the first component of ‘costs’ relates to their income streams.\n-   People need to pay for the connectivity. In telecommunications terms this relates to a metric called ‘Average Revenue Per User’ or ARPU.\n-   People need to pay to buy the consumer electronics that are used to participate in society in a way that demands ownership of these tools; and,\n-   People are increasingly paying a significant additional fee to international companies who are providing valued services.\n\n_On top of all of that is the cost of living. So, energy, housing, food, health, etc._\n\n> These costs could be reduced to a average number, per hour which is like to be in dollars ($x/h), tens of dollars or perhaps hundreds or thousands of dollars when associated to wealthier people or legal personalities (companies).\n\n> Part of these costs could also consider consequential costs of false assumptions and the insurable benefits of improving the basis upon which decisions are made.\n\nAnother consideration worth thinking about, is the underlying nature of economics and how it is actually made to work. The purpose of money is exchange. So that people who work to do things that are of social value are able to exchange ‘goods and services’ with others.\n\nIf a vast group of **work** types are considered to be ‘free’, this damages society.\n\nI am in no way suggesting that someone should be able to make unfair requests; indeed quite the opposite, but there is a balance to be forged.\n\nTherein; in seeking to align the above considerations with the concept of permissive commons, it must be noted that the world as we know it wouldn’t have been made able to work; as we now benefit from, if the information we knew and had available to us freely; such as language, and the means to discover places and place names; was subject to economic gatekeepers by a few knowable entities who governed those ‘knowledge assets’ world-wide.\n\n> Permissive commons, is about forming a cyber-physical solution to support the continuance of those underlying principles as are required for mankind.\n\nIt is reasonable to consider that the work of someone to do stuff that’s good for humanity, is something that should be supported.\n\nTherein, as an example; if someone fixes a bug in software that may expose IoT infrastructure to exploitation, their ‘fix’ might positively impact billions of devices; and only take, a relatively short time to achieve (ie: hours, days or weeks).\n\n> Say, it is their profession to do these sorts of things; and that, it’s how they support their families and their means to learn and maintain their skills.\n\n_As such, they calculate their cost per hour to be about $500 for this sort of work, so if their work is found to fix a problem and took 20 hours, then that’s a cost of about $10,000._\n\nIf the means to articulate this cost to its use on a billion devices, its not much at all per unit that’s attributed in-order for them to get paid for that work. Therein, the consideration is that as a consequence of the use of time which both supports contribution in addition to consumption; the opportunity to add to calculations basic levels of support for human activity, isn’t a bad thing.\n\n> To do so, would require standards and infrastructure solutions not present today.\n\n_The additional benefit is that if they’ve built in an exploit, then they’re also able to be made accountable for doing so, if it’s been done intentionally._\n\n> This is the sort of opportunity that’s brought about with permissive commons in a way that could be explored further; and its important government plays a role.\n\nThis is not to say that governments should be the sole provider, but rather regulatory frameworks play an important role. This concept ‘permissive commons’ seeks to ‘do away’ with survelliance capitalism in many useful ICT applications; and seeks to better articulates the concept now known as ‘open data’; as to better align what seems to be the underlying intent, with our modern needs, in our modern age; which in-turn, i suggest, needs a re:think.\n\n**IN SUMMARY: JOBS AND PERMISSIVE COMMONS**\n\nToday, there are no shortage of jobs to do, there’s a set of artificial boundaries that have been placed upon the means to pay anything for useful work. The consequence of this policy is that people who want to do good things for society and ‘stuff’ that positively impacts our biosphere; are now often paid far less, than those who knowingly do the opposite, this impacts societal value(s).\n\nAs to assist with considerations i’ve drafted some thought, that i’ve titled ‘[Engineering Einstein](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/engineering-einstein-cab894659c02)’ whilst the underlying hope, is that we’d reinvent the kindness equastion at a time when its well known our biosphere, needs help.\n\nThe means to attribute ‘good work’ with income, needs to be addressed as part of the social factors that relate to how it is commons are produced and maintained. Much like the stonemasons building libraries, it didn’t mean they were paid, forever, every time someone sought to use the commons facility.\n\nThere are an array of distinct and differentiated business systems opportunities that can come about; if we have a little more faith, in humanity.\n\n> Conversely;\n\n> Without the means to articulate the spirit of humanitarian principles, as are in-turn rendered meaningful support by systems of governance; our means, as citizens, to get on with the job of cooperatively attending to issues, becomes unduly hampered.\n\nIf we build a ‘knowledge layer’ of permissive commons to the web, then not only are we made better equipped to build upon the knowledge artifacts distributed by others; but we are also better equipped to qualify what it is we’re most capable as knowledge agents, to render as services for others. The permissive commons frameworks, as does uplift open data, lod-cloud and similarly available systems today; enables a person to analyse themselves, or be permissively analysed by others, in relation to ‘known — knowledge’, to articulate accomplishment, capability and other semantic nuances attributable to a natural agent as are factors relating to trust. These systems are not intended to be ‘open’ but rather permissive, and requires permissive commons in-order to be made to work.\n\nAn alternative is facebook, but we can address these sorts of issues, and it starts with the production of tooling that is made to relied upon for an [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere) of permissive commons; and the way that may be used throughout our world. Whether or not these sorts of systems exist isn’t really a relevant, as it is most likely the case that even if we don’t do that, the engineered future of how things are made to work, will causally impacts us all using informatics.\n\nWe can choose to make sense-making a commercial asset, or define a system that is made to work that employs a set of principles i call ‘permissive commons’. One alternative is better for greed, the other for our biosphere."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/WebCivics Medium Posts/Skills & Social Activities/","title":"Skills & Social Activities"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L4OISutOcf3dWceVbhe3bw.jpeg)\n\nSailing in Melbourne, was traditionally the ‘thing’ that i most enjoyed as a sporting activity that i was most involved with throughout my (past) life… As was highly influenced due to family heritage….\n\nAs is part of life, the means to go out and explore the world, to get involved in social activities; is often curated through clubs.\n\nThe knowledge banking frameworks have been designed to support improved means, to forge an internet connected exchange between real-world opportunities and people. Whether it be finding someone who is interested in playing a game of tennis, or one-on-one basketball; or the ability to go find a sailing boat, to go sail on, the way most do that today — is to get down to the club themselves. Meanwhile, there are members already looking for ‘crew’…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mcWfCapcKVEvkrtygCopHg.jpeg)\n\nThere are an array of relationships between personal attributes, including skills; and the means to discover and engage in activities curated with others.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rD0FLx_UEGXrwIMdft6Ywg.jpeg)\n\nIn a similar way to the frameworks described for small businesses; the means for clubs to curate data-services, provides them an ability to extend the reach of their social-networking environment to encourage and support new people, whilst simultaneously supporting broader needs.\n\nFor Example; Some forms of sports and activities incorporate considerations for children; where those who are involved in organising events; best be safe, for kids, which does in-turn require an array of assessments from the suitability of adults involved in managing events; through to knowledge about the child, for safety purposes.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZNTgwsRB_rSxcEwbeQ9wpA.jpeg)\n\nSafely arriving in Sydney, from Melbourne on a 12 metre America’s Cup Boat (with a winged keel)\n\n_Some activities, like sailing, incurs safety considerations; and it’s problematic when a newcomer says they have skills and experience, when they don’t. This is particularly important when engaging in dangerous adventures with others.._\n\nThe means to facilitate opportunities to get involved in all sorts of social activities; requires the means to address factors relating to trust and honesty.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9HLkZi0FgFUwvvGjmTUMzQ.jpeg)\n\nThe way this can be brought about, with a knowledge banking industry; means that credentials, or verifiable claims can be articulated overtime, as to provide support for those seeking to engage in new activities, with new people, in relation to the skills they are interested in obtaining, and those they already have.\n\nThese skills cross multiple sectors. As such, a ‘working with children check’ & or ‘first aid certificate’; being able to know whether participants know how to swim or have a boating license or sailing insurance; are only some of the sorts of things that are able to be made useful tools, for many purposes.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yR4BaJKxhkjp8_ewMkOwSA.jpeg)\n\nFrom memory, that’s Sir James Hardy on the Helm of KA11, Kookaburra, with us…\n\n> Some skills help to warrant that a person is reasonably able to maintain the safety of themselves and/or others. Yet today, if they claim they’re sufficiently knowledgeable as to know what to do on a sailing yacht, let alone knowing what to do in bad weather and/or off-shore trips; finding out otherwise can be really, very dangerous, for many.\n\n_The means to articulate what skills a person has as to proportionately curate opportunities for positive experiences with others, provides an array of opportunities that are otherwise less easily brought about._\n\n> I’ve seen Police Sergeants in tears, not knowing what they don’t know. Tough, isn’t a quality that makes knowledge & skills of a task redundant. Indeed, its not only dangerous but moreover foolhardy to allow arrogance to suggest otherwise.\n\n> In other cases, the question that spins through the mind of others, is whether it’s worth providing the opportunity, knowing we might need to wash the blood off the deck later on… Running a Spinnaker might look powerful, but only if the person knows how to do it, and why gloves are required on big boats.\n\nThere are many good reasons why it is often harder today, than it should be, to get involved with an array of social activities with others; even though, it is often the case that those with greater economic means, make mistakes along the way, and can with great misfortune, contribute to avoidable problems.\n\nTo address some of these sorts of issues;\n\n-   Clubs often have networked relationships with other clubs that in-turn also supports considerations relating to insurances, for participants.\n-   Many leagues seek to form teams of people who have complimentary level skills.\n\nBut there’s also an array of less organised examples…\n\n-   Backpackers and adventurers may be seeking opportunities to go travelling, or go have some sort of activity that is best done with others.\n-   People and kids might want to get down to a local park and play some sort of game with other kids of their age; parents reasonably desire safety…\n\n_All sorts of people have special needs and the means to support social activities, can be improved by providing solutions that help others be attentive._\n\n#### SOCIETAL CONSIDERATIONS & PHYSICAL & SOCIAL ACTIVITIES\n\nIt is relatively easily communicated when a person obtains some sort of achievement from a computer game; or other form of online interaction.\n\nThe same is not the case with respect to real-world activities, such as sport.\n\nThere is a known health relationship between physical & social activities, and factors relating to health & wellbeing; across all ages of society.\n\nSometimes the sorts of activities that people can ‘get out of the house and do’ are not about sport, but rather about social wellbeing; volunteering their time to go do something that’s good for others and/or good for the environment.\n\nEach of these sorts of activities form meaningful relationships to the character of a person, the capacities they develop in life, for life; alongside an array of other real-world factors that have material, yet often opaque attributes for AI.\n\nOn the upper-side of considerations with respect to the wellbeing of a person who may be considered healthy; there many be many achievements, credentialed attributes that articulate a persons real-world activities in an array of group activities across a spectrum of fields; relating to a happy life.\n\n_On the opposing side of a calculation, there is likely to be poor people who do not._\n\nThe ‘social networking’ solutions of the world today, do not seemingly provide a great deal of functionality as to articulate the characteristics of a person that have been obtained in an environment where they cannot use social networks.\n\n_Whilst this seemingly competitive behaviour, between people going out and doing things that are good for them personally; rather than being consumed in private by online tools that continually seek their attention, online; can be addressed and is part of the R&D undertaken for knowledge banking works…_\n\n#### The means to form legacy credentials\n\nOne of the challenges brought about should these sorts of systems be implemented; is how to articulate historical information, in a reliable format.\n\nIt is believed that this can be achieved in-part, via social & societal reinforcements. If people have been previously involved in clubs, then there will be membership information that can be used to show that; alongside information that relates their past activities to results (particularly in sports).\n\nOther fields of datasets are less easily obtained. So the opportunity becomes how to instigate the ability to start to bring this about, as to make it an opportunity that’s good for societal ecosystems.\n\nTo illustrate one way this might be supported (amongst many) is that many clubs are provided economic support by (local) businesses; in-turn their means to be offered opportunities to sponsor in ways that have data based relationships right through to their businesses offerings, is one way to stimulate new revenue for clubs alongside greater participation with them.\n\nAn old example that was made and ‘_pitched_’ to the local outfit ‘life. be in it’ in 2013–5 is shared below.\n\nThere are many factors relating to how these systems in-turn expand far beyond the relatively simple realm of sporting clubs, as to also bring into consideration factors like the means to learn how to play a musical instrument; or how to learn sign language, or many, many other recreational pursuits that have the meaningful outcome of a healthier and happy life.\n\nShould it be the case, that people can afford to do so.\n\nAs such, one of the notes worth considering lastly, is that there is a consequence to social-cyber systems that do not promote real-world activities with others in social environments, other than by adrev. generating means.\n\nToday, there are increasingly metrics to identify activities of people in relation to online engagement activities; but not so much offline activities. The implications brought about as a consequence, impact societies in many ways.\n\n#### Club Management and Credentials\n\nMany clubs have systems for authenticating access to those clubs, which is facilitated both by way of membership cards and related secure access tokens & keys.\n\nThe knowledge banking systems, provide an alternative means to support the functional purposes of these membership tools, that otherwise incurs additional costs per customer; and are less flexibly employed overall.\n\nWhether it be providing the means for a fee-paying member to gain access to the club, its car-park or other facilities; or the means to associate the member to a membership benefit that may be available elsewhere because their a member; or the ability to associate a member of one club, who has replicable rights with another club (upon the basis that they’re well-behaved); or the means to ensure clubs, that are required to ‘sign in’ visits can do so easily,\n\nThe knowledge banking frameworks support these functional attributes, alongside a great deal more.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if its about helping a person ensure they know how much alcohol their consuming before the want to drive home (ie: ability to associate whether the jug of beer is low-strength or full-strength); or the ability to help someone who might have a gambling addition; or the ability to know, whether someone has acted in a manner that has led them to damaging property at one club, seeking trusted access to another.\n\nThe means to curate how these sorts of things work, need to be empowered by a system that supports the individuals means to manage their own data; which is achieved through a knowledge banking system, that works with other systems, produced and operated by other groups of humans elsewhere."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/WebCivics Medium Posts/Small to Medium Business, WebPayments & Knowledge Banking/","title":"Small to Medium Business, WebPayments & Knowledge Banking"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Democratising AI marketing, online sales and payment services online can help stimulate economy in an array of positive ways.\n\nWhilst many of my articles seek to articulate the benefits for individuals, this article illustrates solutions for ‘_small to medium_’ businesses, as part of the broader ecosystem solutions, framework.\n\nWorks on these sorts of use-cases extend back to 2010 and in some cases long before then, whilst continually developed since. The hard bit, about a ‘knowledge banking’ system is about how to support the needs of individuals; but should this be accomplished, it would be wrong to suggest that these systems are, not good for business. In anyway.\n\nThere are many forms of small to medium businesses. From the many different form of shop based retailers; through to service providers. in all cases, from tradespeople to personal services, apparel, electronics, transport, travel & almost any other vendor situation, data services enrich opportunity.\n\nE-Commerce platforms today often provide opportunities for specific market problems, although they generally do so in a manner that has been designed to make it easier to start using their solution, than it is to move to something else; and, most-often acts to obtain a proportion of the transaction revenue.\n\nToday, there are many ‘traditional’ solutions, ranging from shopify to uber, airbnb to ebay; the emerging market for people engage in business online has already become well developed.\n\nWhat the proposed ‘knowledge banking’ frameworks in-turn attempt to do, is to extend the way traditional businesses are able to operate independent to these broader ‘silo’ based solutions, by way of providing ‘web of data’ tooling.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NzmSjtQcqnuuFztQxdo1yg.jpeg)\n\nThe “LocPoi” Diagram from 2012 describes some of the functional characteristics that are now able be supported via W3C standards works done since then….\n\n> It is hoped that businesses will not only benefit, but also make use of these solutions as to provide digital, machine-readable receipts to their customers.\n\nMost businesses today operate some sort of business & stock management platform, to support the operational needs of their business. In some cases, many of these solutions are developed by industry specific software providers, whilst in others — more generic tools are used, and online platforms make use of prominent web content management systems (CMS) to support online needs.\n\n> Online CMSs include Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla alongside others.\n\nWhilst some of these CMS projects are proprietary and hosted solutions, many others are built by the ‘open source software’ community. These online software environments build upon collaborative works undertaken by many across the world, to produce software infrastructure that can be modified for use for the purposes of specific websites / end-users.\n\n> [WordPress’ market share is 34% of all websites](https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/)\n\nTraditional website solutions often already use semantic web tools, without (necessarily) knowing it. Two of the most commonly used semantic web tools are the services that support the means for a website to easily publish web-content into facebook alongside ‘web of data’ services to enable search-engine discovery of web-content and related business information. Yet the use of these tools does not go far enough, as to best support small businesses\n\nIf the web is built in a manner that provides improved support for payments and electronic contracts, the means to develop and deliver new services that need not have anything to do with other 3rd party solutions, is brought about.\n\nTo achieve a solution that’s able to extend a businesses self-managed footprint to the online space and/or interactively with it; which is expected to\n\n-   drop the cost of online sales\n-   improve the use of online sales infrastructure to get more sales\n-   improve customer relationship management\n-   improve support for multi-vendor transactions (ie: retailer + delivery)\n-   provide support advanced AI compatible Retail Receipts for customers\n-   Improve product / service — consumer labelling opportunities\n-   Improve support for supply-chain engagement (ie: see a film at a cinema, get a copy of film-related promotional material)\n-   Improve the means to provide valued services, without breaching privacy.\n\nThe means to do so incorporates the need to address a few object parts;\n\nnamely,\n\n1.  **Fulfilling Payments**\n\nOne of the first parts that are needed to make it work, is a payments framework. There is no point creating a sales opportunity, if the means to fulfil the transaction for both parties, isn’t possible.\n\nSo, without getting too far into the payment processes, lets just say — there’s tools for that, and the knowledge banking infrastructure is designed to improve support for those underlying requirements.\n\nIndeed, existing banks have an array of tools available to help with this today. Whilst there are issues with the way they provide these tools, the ability to solve the payment issue from a business perspective, is relatively easy.\n\n**2. Customer Relationships & Trust**\n\nThe customer relationship constituents, such as customer loyalty solutions, promotions and similar; alongside the means to support the growth of trust, which has a direct relationship to whether and how people make transactions online; in particular, with small business, is part of the building blocks required to provide an alternative from the traditional, global alternatives.\n\n**3. Web of Data: forming electronic tools to curate commercial offers online**\n\nOne of the reasons why apps for takeaway food have developed such an enormous commercial footprint is that these platforms publish the offerings made by businesses offering take-away food. This is in addition to the underlying curation of ‘gig workers’ who deliver the food (transport workers).\n\n### So, What sort of things can be achieved?\n\nThe first part of a solution is about how existing tools are able to be extended as to support this proposed ‘knowledge banking’ enabled approach.\n\nThe first part relies upon the ability for a businesses banking environment itself, to support these AI empowered ‘knowledge banking’ services on behalf of its business customers. This in-turn assists them, in improving trust factors.\n\n> This is envisaged to be an extension of already existing e-commerce services.\n\nThe second part, is in forming the means for existing platform tools, but those operating within businesses (ie: Point of Sale Systems) and their online sites, to both become interoperable, so sales that come via online systems do so in a manner that’s supported by the point of sales system and relating systems.\n\nDo achieve this, ontologies need to be employed as to support ‘web of data’ related frameworks that are in-turn used by the (AI) Agents of all other actors.\n\nFor example;\n\nProtege, a leading open-source application for building ontologies, provides a [pizza ontology example](https://protege.stanford.edu/ontologies/pizza/pizza.owl). This can in-turn be used to illustrate the constituents of a pizza, whether it be the consumer who seeks to ‘design their own’ pizza, or whether it be standard offerings made by a pizza store.\n\nWhere this becomes more interesting; is when the broader field of semantic inferences can be made; as to relate the nutritional needs of a consumer, and the options made available by a retailer.\n\nTherein, there are two fields of consideration that are interactive in nature; the means to support the needs of ‘consumers’ and those of businesses.\n\n**Private Consumer Information**\n\nAssume the consumer is operating their own inforg, and in it, they’re collecting an array of information that relates to their health and wellbeing.\n\nThis would in-turn include an array of information about their diet, which could be collected in connection to the products they’ve consumed alongside information about the recipes used for things they’ve made themselves.\n\nA retail app that is intended to support the purchase of take-away food is an inappropriate informatics environment to store all of this data; but the use of it, can make a meaningful influence on purchasing behaviour.\n\nTherein / thereafter; such transactions may not simply be for one person, but rather a group. Again — the retail or app provider should not reasonably have the right to obtain the commercial use of any such behavioural analytics data.\n\nSo, if we imagine there’s this place where consumers have a means to privately go through their own decision making practices.\n\nThen, go out and seek an offer from a suitable provider (ie: pizza = local) and find what’s on offer that fits their needs.\n\nThey may use better produce than alternative providers in the local area, and these decisions may in-turn support people in the community and their dietary needs better than cheaper or more well-known alternative providers.\n\n> They may make a specific effort to seek their ingredients from sustainable food production providers; so animal products, are from well treated animals.\n\n**_Back to business_**\n\nFrom the pizza store point of view, they may have a large mass of customers who trust them and offer an array of reviews and social-peer level support that assists that business, in its means to attract new customers.\n\nThe ability to use ontological approaches means customers, whether they’re in the area for a short-time, perhaps visiting friends; or live there, can in-turn be supported by the technical means to communicate products in a standard way. Where this is applied to pizzas, its about the ingredients and how its made.\n\n> I want a BBQ Chicken Pizza, +++BBQ Sauce, no chicken. said one customer, many years ago. whilst my personal fav. was the in-house ‘souvlaki pizza’, not on the menu.\n\nSo, the benefit of using ontologies (which in-turn relate to the concept of permissive commons) is that these schemas not only provide a structured manner for a retailer (and their system) to quickly and easily make use of existing information / datasets, that relates to what it is they sell; but it’s also able to be linked across their supply chain, and based upon the permissions set-out by their businesses online systems; consumers are able to make use of it in so many ways, it would be entirely inappropriate and too complex for any small to medium business to program any system that did it all themselves.\n\nThe additional benefits then include the means to easily provide machine-readable receipts, which can in-turn link across to supplemental information about the product or produce as is made available by others; and, the means to use AI or moreover, semantic inferencing, to support the little differences.\n\nTherein; a decision is being made to produce tools that are intended to support consumers, which in-turn support new opportunities for businesses.\n\nA few other examples are thereafter provided.\n\n**Clothing measurements**\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UZ7ALlO3TO6mWjFIGwpTTw.gif)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ciSN8RUJ26GioLEhJrWHkQ.jpeg)\n\nWhether it be the ability to figure out whether a fabric will change after it is washed, whether it is suitable for a person with allergies; or the means to find attire that’ll fit yourself, or others. The means to articulate head, body and feet measurements can not only help with online purchases, and any purchases for another person; the tooling to do so is also instrumental for the creation of new businesses that may specialise in the manufacture of custom fit attire.\n\n> It is often now the case that it is cheaper to find clothes to donate to homeless people online, than is the case if they went to a second-hand shop that markets its purpose as to support the needs of such people.\n\n**Travel**\n\nThe vast majority of travel websites provide a listing of accommodation providers, given a star rating based on what it is they provide. More broadly, in the vast majority of country towns, cities and suburbs across the world; there are alternatives to a wonderful concierge or holiday resort provider.\n\nThis is in-turn coupled with the needs of many business, particularly small businesses in country suburbs. Therein, as AirBnB so well illustrates, there are many different accommodation options available in all sorts of places around the world. What is more difficult to identify at present, on the web, is the multitude of local providers whose livings, their means to support their families, often relies upon their means to provide valued services to travellers.\n\nWhether it be finding the local cinema, or someone to take you horse riding or fishing; there are often people in these places more than happy to do so.\n\nFor events, such as weddings (first investigated ~2006–7) there are then very complex scenarios that make the task of getting a good pizza order, comparatively simple. The means to identify caterers, venues and the means to form and support group deals; alongside activities, and travel experience opportunities that both suit the needs of patrons & provide new experiences.\n\nThe means to support the needs of international visitors who may be more easily served through means to support international language services.\n\nThe means for small businesses of many types to have these underlying data-services that support the means for their websites to easily communicate with other online services in a common, AI enabled, way; helps to foster the means for others to curate requests for sales opportunities; from the means to organise events or enjoy a travel experience,\n\n> Through to the means to remember that antique they may have found, and array for it to be purchased and shipped back-home upon their return.\n\n**_Loyalty & relationship based marketing & feeding the homeless_**\n\nThere is an ability for these systems to build customer relationships between sellers and consumers; it’s frankly, that simple.\n\nThe means to do so, provides a capacity for the consumer to select how they want to interact with that vendor, whether they want to get constant notifications — or not; and,\n\nThe vendor can in-turn make use of those data-services as part of broader marketing campaigns and related systems, in a permissive format.\n\nOne of the more specific considerations that has been made over sometime, is that people today carry less cash. As such, those in need are now increasingly served solely by often ineffective / inefficient institutional services; and related gatekeepers.\n\nThere are many reasons why this is a backwards step.\n\nIn my experience, those who are in-need more often than not, do actually have special needs that are not being met. It is all good and well to sustain their ability to stay in a life (for so long as they sustain life) in or of poverty, but it’s quite another thing to form the means to address underlying issues as to provide such people the means to heal, and get on with life.\n\nAll too often, the underlying reason for their circumstance, is made to be impossible for them to address; and so, an abuse cycle commences, incurring the means for others to garnish an income to support those who are homeless which can escalate & manifest problems.\n\n> So, imagine if there was a means for people who self-identify, in a dignity preserving manner, to be a person in-need; and that the systems, on that basis, provide a facility for those who seek to be charitable, to provide support by way of food, or help fund the means for a person to see a lawyer, or doctor\n\n> Imagine if, there was a means to form social projects that benefited the environment in some way, and also acted to distribute job opportunities to those in need more directly; rather than funding recruitment businesses first.\n\nThe economic ecosystems brought about by these ontologically powered frameworks provide a capacity to produce distinguished economic solutions; ranging from providing repeat customers a discount, to providing means through which charitable funds can be used to discount (or co-fund) the cost of particular ‘things of need’ to those living below the poverty line, and in-turn also — the means for a person to go have a conversation with a person living on the street. Then after doing so, be able to communicate kindness..\n\nBe able to have a economic means with businesses, that might mean a business seeks a tax-benefit for doing critical services, like accountancy, law and health on a discounted basis for a % of their time; and that the gap, be funded by the public who engage themselves and provide funds for specified purposes. In this way, we can better feed, provide shelter, defend the human rights of those who are otherwise left to be used by others as a threat to illustrate what happens to people who don’t comply to wrongdoing by others.\n\nIn a happier sense,\n\nThere is a means to support better evaluation practices that in-turn act to better support the discovery of small businesses in addition to providing the means to inspect and engage with alot more knowledge in relation to that business; as to improve decision making practices by and for consumers.\n\nWhether it be the means to figure out if that cheaper TV, is actually cheaper in the end; as may be evaluated by understanding energy usage & life span info..\n\nor, the ability to inspect the supply-chain of a bag a peas or berries, to see not only where the products come-from; but whether workers, are treated well.\n\n> There is a means to articulate the supply of services, with happy customers; that can help better understand the provenance of economic activities as does relate to particular employees / individuals who have been involved.\n\nSo how is it done?\n\nThe vast majority of POS systems have a capacity to be transformed / updated, as to support the particular tooling required, based on SemWeb.\n\nThis can in-turn provide support for the development of plugins for the vast majority of website solutions; that can in-turn support online discovery & sales.\n\nBetter yet, as these systems are built upon the premise that consumers already have a place to both safely & securely store and operate their own data; the issues relating to data-privacy and any breach / attack on small business websites, can broadly be made a problem that goes away; and the consequence of how the problem is responded to, leads to far more powerful capabilities as a result; for consumers, vendors and supply chains.\n\nThese solutions provide a means for vendors to better engage with trusted suppliers as to produce and provide offerings, that are valued by the market."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/WebCivics Medium Posts/Tech for Permissive Commons/","title":"Tech for Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### How is a ‘permissive commons’ system made to work, and what does it provide, technically?\n\n**Background**\n\nI have previously written a less-technical article on [permissive commons that can be found here](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e). This is part of an overall [ecosystems approach that is intended to forge a ‘human centric’ informatics environment](https://medium.com/webcivics/).\n\nThe difference between traditional ‘silo’d’ approaches and this ‘human centric’ approach is in the provision of safe & secure informatics environments, where the data collected about people and in relation to people; is stored on behalf of those people.\n\nThis methodology is an alternative to the already well developed ‘[_persona ficta_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)’ centric alternatives where information is stored in relation to web-services operated by a website provider in the more traditional sense..\n\nTo achieve an outcome where people can beneficially ‘bank’ their own data and operate its use with applications, systems need to use decentralisation methods in a different way to how it is generally done already.\n\n> Existing sites (like facebook, youtube, google, etc.) are distributed across a multitude of servers across the world as to make their websites work, their decentralised systems still centralise authentication, database management and commercial / legal business systems.\n\nIn the alternative method that is sought to be achieved by a human centric web methodology; these business functions become technically decentralised as to bring to effect a means where the extension of agency (ie: personal agency) becomes inclusive to both data, and the repercussive informatics events that are derived as a consequence of personal expressions of thought.\n\n> To achieve this outcome, a different set of tooling is required.\n\nWhilst these alternative systems are designed to support all forms of legal actors (and their tools); the consequential technical design element that is sought to be achieved by way of Permissive Commons, relates to the functional requirements of seeking to obtain knowledge about the world in the form of structured data and to make use of that within private settings.\n\nIt is difficult to find images that describe how this can be made to work within a [knowledge bank](https://medium.com/p/164e19242b99) that supports [inforgs](https://medium.com/webcivics/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4). Nonetheless, there are many examples of how this sort of technical infrastructure is used in conventional web-based business model backed web-services.\n\n### To better support evaluation; I’ll use healthcare informatics as an example. .\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nnPi4Gg5UOnQQLOyVct_Tg.png)\n\nSource: [**A survey of current trends in computational drug repositioning**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274389217_A_survey_of_current_trends_in_computational_drug_repositioning)\n\n**Computational Repositioning strategies** represents a series of data-sources and related libraries of information, all of which could be different forms of permissive commons.\n\nTherein, societal knowledge that has been produced in many ways, is able to be communicated in a common ‘linked data’ format (or transformed to linked-data, whilst many [health-sci systems are in LinkedData and often ‘Open’](https://lod-cloud.net/)).\n\nNow for a moment, imagine you’ve got a place to store all the information that relates to your health. Perhaps there is an extraordinary change, and the safest places for personal information are provided by Google, Apple, Facebook and similar. Or perhaps, there’s a knowledge bank that kinda needs, permissive commons (as i continue to explain how, and why).\n\nSo, the above image illustrates how there’s a bunch of scientific knowledge about the world, but in-order to make use of it personally generated information, or information generated about a person, needs to be processed in relation to available knowledge in the world to the articulated ‘senses’ transcribed to data, by way of — what i’d call, an inforg. For purposes relating to health; this could include,\n\nSocial factors, both those relating to the spread of disease and those relating to behaviours where [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) could be used to process communications to see if you are happy or sad, and if there’s trends at different times of the day.\n\nThere could be dietary considerations, that could review not simply the information about the objects that have been consumed, but also the [entire history of the ingredients](https://github.com/ouisharelabs/food-dashboard) relating to the production and distribution of those food and beverage objects and information about the make-up of those food-stuffs.\n\n> It might also form relational links, so if a few people who ate at one restaurant all get sick at a similar time, this can form part of the inferencing capacities.\n\nInformation about exercise, sleep cycles alongside other biosensors & ‘smart things’ like ‘smart toilets’ producing health-data alongside the information created about persons every time the person gets a medical check, test, image or procedure.\n\nThe analytics information that helps cameras identify who you are, such as your walking gait could be stored as to analyse for changes that may denote a health problem emerging.\n\nWhat is Ontological Design?\n\nAll of this information needs to be stored in a structured format that is able to be understood by the software processes and systems made able to use it. The term used to define these vocabularies is ontology, which provides electronic record data-structures, that are able to be produced using multiple ontologies.\n\n> Traditional approaches brings all of this data into the same ‘silo’ as the provider, but their design practices, relating to why they do so, isn’t necessarily about you.\n\nAnther problem is, that due to real-world issues that do reasonably relate to personal agency and trust; these systems are often incomplete. Considerations such as whether an intimate partner is being intimate with others, and how that may have social-health effects, isn’t part of it. The implications of loosing a job and financial distress, not part of it. The information about whether there is a known environmentally toxic event, not part of it. Not-only do these practical health impacting circumstances, the problem develops a situation where solutions either seek to obtain all the information they can possibly get as to improve the way their AI systems work; or, end-up being /less unreliable.\n\nSo, the underlying purpose of decentralising ‘[open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data)’ (note ‘[principles](https://opendatacharter.net/principles/)’) in a manner that supports the needs of institutional (and other) producers of to employ and rely upon reformulated ‘_permissive commons_’ informatics products; is about providing the means for their tools to be used by persons in a particular way; that seeks to better support privacy, or moreover, human dignity (and therein, confidentiality).\n\n> If couples form agreements about how their relationship works, that’s fine — but it’s not something that needs to be published on facebook. If there are relationship problems that relate to clinically relevant considerations, how could it be dignified to be treated for something else entirely? If information about you and your relationships in the form of your ‘digital twins’ is being used to define you, wouldn’t you want to define in that environment how you treat others with dignity? or is it suggested, that these sorts of consideration, really don’t matter…\n\n[Semantic Web technologies](https://medium.com/webcivics/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) are not only used today, but are about the only global ‘patent pool protected’ royalty free method able to power advanced AI.\n\nWhilst health is amongst the highest, of high-stakes use-cases, the principle methodology sought to be employed to produce a human centric web is intended to result in an outcome that is considered ‘safe, for health’.\n\nPermissive commons is intended to provide the means for institutional providers, who have huge server-farm capabilities (something a home-server just can’t do on its own) to get a functional local copy of information from sources across the world; and to then, empower human beings to make use of it without having to necessarily share how they’ve used it or what it says, to anyone unless they’ve defined how they want it to be used for the benefit of others. The only two fragmented elements are that;\n\nA. If anonymised statistical data can be collected and aggregated from a multitude of ‘knowledge banks’ this would be good for research & STEM.\n\nB. Circumstances whereby law provides the capacity to seek specific info.\n\nMore broadly; as to recenter the article away from the specificities of health,\n\nThe permissive commons framework in-turn considers also derivative considerations relating to other articles and resources that consider the need to have [a micropayments standards](https://medium.com/webcivics/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b) alongside the work supported by [Amanda Jansen](https://medium.com/u/34a278c5b33a) on [value accounting initiatives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UK9eWFjQRbGtF7wAMBNyntT7kZNpvSIe5cSY_VAuE0Q/edit?ts=5c9aec18); and those of her (/our) works on [assessing the qualities of existing DLT solutions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZHjCnQZRUC6Dkqv2yA4H9Djd5Sf6z04-SfyquIV0YI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n> These works are in-turn was produced to both to support this scope of works; alongside the means to evaluate biosphere impacts (ie: energy consumption) alongside other attributes that are envisaged to inform the rationale as to why open standards are required.\n\nSo; to recap,\n\nDynamic (semantic) Agents are a form of software agent that makes use of ‘AI’ tools that make use of available data in association to queries, and the rules set-out by someone that defines how the request for information should respond.\n\n> The practice method sought by a human centric approach centres upon the means for a natural person to make use of a dynamic agent (ai) for personal use; without being unnecessarily (or so it may be considered due to the advent of a solution) interference by international or corporate desires being injected into the ‘sense making’ methodologies of dynamic agents; and the effects this has on both natural agents, and broader socio-economic systems upon both man-made and biosphere environments.\n\n_A key element to how this is thought to be best made to work; is through this concept of ‘_[_permissive commons_](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)_’ and as the intention of this article; is to illustrate some of the more technical details…._\n\nThe most basic explanation is: that the informatics assets required for ‘freedom of though’ need to be distributed across the web as a core component of how it is that our cyber environment is made to work.\n\n**TECHNICAL INTRODUCTIONS**\n\nThe concept of permissive commons is built upon the idea of [information centric networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-centric_networking) approach, that is similar to many DLT solutions in many ways. One technical difference, is that i’m suggesting a standard be produced which is seemingly the domain of IETF.\n\nPermissive commons infrastructure could thereafter, incorporate economic considerations that seek to fund the availability of this ‘content’ or ‘information’ centric networking approach. The rationale being that the core libraries required for enterprise systems as part of the functional requirements for distributing trusted copies of datasets; share similar technical properties to the requirements that exist to support micropayments.\n\n> Additionally, the means to provide a means to attribute ‘work’ with fair-payments for workers, alongside attribution, would improve support for international law as may in-turn act to support improved qualities relating to trust dependencies.\n\nThe objective, should a protocol be defined as a standards, would be to deliver an opportunity ‘_better than bitcoin_’, that acts in-turn, to support kindness, human creativity & STEM in knowledge based activities, alongside economics.\n\n### **Functional Requirements**\n\n**Linked Data**\n\nThe methodology MUST support linked-data URIs. This may include [DIDs](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/did) or alternative IANA assigned URI-Schema that would support a similar function.\n\n**Version Control**\n\nThe methodology MUST provide the ability to reference the temporal attribution (version) in addition to the identifier list object (‘most recent’ URI) and provide the means to support inferencing mapping should variations between the two exist.\n\n> When actors in a social system are generating data overtime, these events are temporally associated. URIs that refer to resources that are not temporally notated bring about a problem where the definition of that resource can be changed overtime; which in-turn has the effect of changing the semantics\n\n**Decentralised**\n\nThe methodology MUST support the ability to obtain for local use a copy of the informatics datafile for private use in relation to semantic inferencing services; and related functional requirements.\n\n**Permissive**\n\nThe methodology MUST support an array of permissive modalities that range from a single custodian signature to that of a permissive group; inclusive of workflow considerations (roles: ie: draft, unofficial, official, etc.).\n\nPermissions should include considerations about read, write, append, bi-Directional Links, etc.\n\n> In many use-cases networked informatics resources need to maintain persistence and shouldn’t be deleted, and is noted in relation to the concept of [CoolURIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/) by [TimBL](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) that is summarised as ‘cool uris do not change’\n\n**Multiplicity: The means to define a multitude or _plurality_ of ledgers, with a multiplicity of permissive orientations as to produce ‘fit for purpose’ informatics resources.**\n\nIn-order to support an array of functional considerations, the suggested method would produce a multitude of record ledgers and support distribution of a portion of any one entire ledger.\n\nRecords formats should (or could) be ‘subject’ orientated; with attributable records to that ‘subject’ being made available independent of other ‘subjects’ or related records.\n\nAn example may be that a device being used to find a toilet, doesn’t need the information about all public toilets in the world; they may only need to get the information about the toilets that are nearby. Operators of infrastructure in Australia are unlikely to reliably require information about toilets around the world, they may just need the information about ones that are located in the geographical region relating to the persons who their services, are serving.\n\n**Tamper evidence**\n\nEach record should be signed with a cryptographic instrument that provides the means for consumers of those data-files to check provenance & supplier of the record; as does relate to the issuer (or governor) of it. This is required for several reasons; including, providing a means to defend against ‘man in the middle’ AI (content / semantics level) attacks.\n\n**Transport**\n\nTransport security is a requirement. Cryptographic instruments should be used in a manner that is supportive of KYCC/AML related laws; whilst defending against unlicensed attack vectors / actors.\n\n(by ‘unlicensed’ i mean, unlawful acts by any party inclusive to authorities domestic or international)\n\n**Content Payloads (nb: i’ll figure out a better name later).**\n\nContent payloads are intended to support semantic informatics structures that are in-turn provided for the purposeful use of a semantic agent in relation to the creation and use of personal documents and related AI functions.\n\nThe operational & functional supply of _the informatics needs_ for software applications, requires the software to be able to process the information.\n\nMore broadly, the consideration is that much like downloading a copy of a blockchain (or torrent); the distribution of ‘knowledge’ and ‘information’ assets, that are able to be consumed by agents, is considered to be a functional requirement that should be supported by an approach that makes use of relevant (W3C, IETF, etc.) open standards.\n\nThese file structures should in-turn also support permissive use structures, which in-turn relates to the functional properties of services provided by knowledge banks. It is ordinarily impossible to ensure a copy of information that is successfully transmitted to another device, is able to be made inaccessible at a later date. Knowledge Banks, on the other hand, would be morally / legally obligated to perform this function; and are able to support queries by way of obtaining the query request, and processing it locally.\n\n**Content Object (ICON)**\n\nThe content payload should be able to be represented as an ICON with a short description, links and other ‘authorship’ related information (ie: inclusive to any license & governance related terms).\n\nFormat: SVG (can PNGs support this? Re: packaging, it might be easier to deliver in a HTML wrapper)\n\nUse cases:\n\n-   Providing ‘easy to use’ query object co-development\n\n> Ie: Sparql constituent of a query representing a search for a person with a particular attribute (gender, etc.). The utility of this is to form constituent sparql query objects that can form facets of a more complex query.\n\nFunctionally similar to an [openbadge](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) the principle objective is to improve usability and trust related attributes; as graphical, trade markable icons can be used to associate to the provider of a particular dataset resource.\n\n> Ie: Australian Bureau of Statistics ( or any other provider) icon & associated information\n\nPermissive Commons — Content Types\n\n-   Sparql Queries\n-   Ontologies\n-   ‘Open Data’\n-   Biosphere / Natural World Data-Sets\n-   Human World data sets (langage, etc.)\n-   Discovery / ‘information centric’ networking datasets\n\n**PERMISSIVE TREE SUPPORT**\n\nThe GIS (geographical information services) frameworks may incorporate information on a multitude of layers; that are in-turn likely to have an array of custodial relationships with an array of stakeholders.\n\n> A towns local government may govern the allocation of the spaces; including those of private property, whilst the utility of private-properties may have many owners overtime, involve real-estate agents; and tenants (those who rent the place and retain rights over the properties use).\n\nWhilst distinct, there are a series of similar ‘ecosystems’ evaluations that occur with all sorts of things in the real-world spaces, places & related things (of both a natural, man-made & artificial ‘cyber’ nature). This in-turn relates informatics structures to governance models, addressability and interactivity between ‘conscious minds’ and things; in a format that forms a multi-modal ‘graph’ nature; with temporal associations.\n\nPerhaps also, another important note may be to highlight the use-case of associations with [IoT, software interfaces and other ‘digital twin’ aspects](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2).\n\n**Notation Method**\n\nLinked data standards & related formats.\n\nFor reasons i do not entirely understand, it seems N3 might be the preferred serialisation format; and whilst documentation might focus on that, json-ld and other serialisation formats should be interchangeably supported.\n\nThe history of this is that TimBL defined N3 as an RDF Native serialisation (as described in his [design notes](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/)) but the problem was that developers who were building applications based on a ‘silo’ approach found it hard to grasp. To support RDF uses, _particularly_ for silo’d applications & related services, like search, the means to adapt JSON to support RDF was produced as JSON-LD.\n\nToday, there is alot of JSON-LD & JSON related APIs and services, alongside people who are more easily able to use it. Yet TimBL often remarks his preference for N3, and frankly — i think his a trustworthy guide on the issue.\n\nThe other factors worth noting are; a. serialisation formats are interchangeable, as can be demonstrated via [Any23](https://any23.apache.org/). Secondly, as the purposeful design of these ‘permissive commons’ structures are, by association to philosophical design, different to the otherwise well-developed centralised approaches; any additional barriers brought about by using N3 may serve as a reminder for the moral and ethical differences that relate to systems that are designed to support permissive commons structures.\n\n> noting also that the json license includes a stipulated term “[The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.](https://www.json.org/license.html)” that seems in many ways, far too vague.\n\n**Ability to support semantic cryptographic proofs**\n\nThe concept of ‘semantic proofs’ probably won’t make sense to most; generally, i’m saying that we can form methods to support ‘blockchain like’ functionality, without enormous dependencies on energy consumption as engendered through ‘proof of work’ schemes and formats.\n\nThe alternative illustrated therein; is about the use of social-semantics & cryptography in addition to cryptographic proofs. Some examples include [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof); but all together — there’s experts who know best.\n\n**Refining the definition of ‘permissive commons’: illustratively**\n\nAs illustrated above; if a person has a health problem, the best way to address it is to ensure those involved in the person / patients healthcare; are mutually able to be made aware of what it is that is going on.\n\n> This consideration does not extend to people who do not have a need to know.\n\nWhether it be mental health, gynaecological health or the many other fields; the patient should be the curator of who has access to their health information; whilst not being best placed to undertake meaningful actions that can improve health, based upon clinical insights engendered through studies.\n\nTherein; the consideration of ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ extends to the informatics patterns where select groups are permissively provided use of (point) data materials where required; and in-turn generate data themselves about what it is they did when interacting with that data.\n\ntherein also — simultaneously, the means for decentralised ‘data curators’ (ie: knowledge banks) to aggregate records as to render ‘anonymised’ results that can permissively be back-traced to the point data; for the purposes of legal audits (accountability) whilst not breaching privacy, is sought to be supported by these permissive protocol methodologies..\n\n**Compiled and component (signed) distributions**\n\nArtefact offerings provided by a permissive commons informatics distribution system should offer the ability to GET a compiled version; that incorporates the semantically referenced related datasets, in addition to an uncompiled (smaller) version; that requires GET requests when specified records relating to the dataset are required, but not available locally.\n\n(somewhat similar to some of the above notes)\n\n> Example 1: might be that someone gets a parking ticket (or speeding ticket) they want to dispute, and want to use data that is available to create a ‘verifiable claim’ in relation to their lodged dispute.\n\n> Example 2: A system requires an ‘offline’ copy, for activities in environments that have poor (or no) access to internet.\n\n### EXISTING WORKS\n\nTechnically, this proposition shares many qualities of existing solutions; and it is now desirable to get a subject matter expert involved to form the cohesive technical specification, method and proof of concept.\n\nConsiderations therein; include,\n\nGIT is a version control software that supports many of the local and networkable requirements; although some elements appear to not be available with existing solutions available today.\n\nThe benefit of using GIT is that it’s already built into the vast majority of web servers and is well-developed technology.\n\nBitTorrent (and similar) demonstrates the ability to resource a data-resource and distribute it using P2P techniques. WebTorrent and WebDHT are amongst the ‘family’ of solutions available, worthy of consideration.\n\n-   DAT\n-   IPFS\n-   Mango ([https://medium.com/@alexberegszaszi/mango-git-completely-decentralised-7aef8bcbcfe6](https://medium.com/@alexberegszaszi/mango-git-completely-decentralised-7aef8bcbcfe6) )\n-   Holochain (as distinct to the company ‘holo’ and its AUTH methodology)\n\n**Other Constituent Technology considerations**\n\n[**draft-cavage-http-signatures-10 - Signing HTTP Messages**  \n_Network Working Group M.

The core principle is that the governed, citizens, are represented by an elected representative of the people, by geographical region, etc.\n\n> Modern politics makes for messy issues, although it is easily argued that the governance of government, has never delivered the promises it says it seeks.\n\n[Knowledge Banking Infrastructure](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99) is built upon digital identity frameworks for humans; that incorporates in-turn, an array of ‘verifiable claims’ tooling.\n\nThis tooling, incorporates the means to identify where a person resides, nationality alongside other facts that interact with political interactions. The implication is that by providing citizens legally defensible, digital identity infrastructure there is a means to improve democratic engagement.\n\nRepresentatives of our system of democracy have a duty to consider the views of their electorate. A traditional problem has been the means to curate sufficient support throughout an electorate as to prosecute a shared value.\n\nWhat a knowledge banking infrastructure framework does, is provide, the infrastructure solutions required to support electronic contracts; or in other words, the ability to engage in lawful activities with others online, in a manner that is as legally enforceable as any other economic activity, online.\n\nTherein, the means for an elected representative to garnish an understanding of an issue that is brought to their attention by member of their electorate, becomes far simpler. Rather than political interactions being provided by way of twitter, or disseminated by ‘police news’ and fake news publications; the means for citizens to engage in topics of interest with their elected members of parliament, becomes part of what can be brought about; by a knowledge banking sector (or any official, digital identity solution — whether KYC/AML is provided via commercial agents, or as an infrastructure service for society).\n\nIrrespective of how the engagement methodology is brought about; the next series of problems, relates to how the engagement method with members of parliament is brought about.\n\nThere are several resources available that provide parliamentary information online; yet the means to easily resource, review and process these infrastructure assets and article is made more difficult than needs be.\n\n> There are also party politics that plays a significant role, as the situation of a void of reliable opinion being sourced from the community, leads to other interests playing a more vocal and directive role.\n\nThe ability for independent members of parliament to operate at the same level of sophistication as party members, is also something worth noting.\n\nWhilst a study of parliamentary spending on parliamentary staffers overtime, by comparison to population growth (ie: are parliamentarians understaffed?)\n\nThe ability for aspiring independent parliamentary contenders to grapple with how our system of democracy works and how to engineer position statements on many complex topics; is more likely not, to have been breed into them by way of party participation from a youthful age (‘the cultivated politician’) but rather, relate to issues based politics and the desire to get something, meaningful done.\n\nTherein — there are an array of factors that relate to how [permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e) is intended to support nuanced use-cases; that support (amongst other things) electoral engagement in current affairs & political decision making. This is in-turn intended to be integrated, in a manner that’s consistent with how the broader ecosystem is made to work. For parliamentarians websites, the solution is very similar to that of [small businesses](https://medium.com/webcivics/small-to-medium-business-webpayments-knowledge-banking-6b0e15c7e71d) or [sports & clubs](https://medium.com/webcivics/skills-social-activities-2124e52bd877).\n\nAs such, the blend between ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ and [knowledge banking infrastructure](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99); can also, assist in communicating in connection to recommendations made by community members, their skills & character traits. This in-turn also kinda supplements the ideas illustrated by [knowledge clouds](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9) alongside considerations made about, [statistics](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-numbers-encyclopaedia-open-economics-statistics-data-7fbc6bdf9c00) (& analytics).\n\n> Therein; if someone is linked to a competing incumbent, or if a person is a subject matter expert within the field, these sorts of traits can be identified and weighted, alongside other historical attributes with meaningful relations to contributors.\n\nAmongst the many key benefits brought about by a knowledge banking approach, as is distinct to the way major silos work today; is that, the security infrastructure, would be governed domestically, by domestic operators.\n\nWhilst it is entirely able to be the case, that international crypto-relations can be made as to warrant the fact that a domestic government has not tampered with results or manipulated key decisions; the underlying series of practical architectural solutions frameworks, is considered to be quite different to alternatives.\n\nPolitics, the governance of government and public service; is part of the daily lives of all people. Today, we haven’t used technology to support democracies.\n\nIt’s about time, we start thinking about whether or not, it’s important to do so."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/Non-HTTP(s) Protocols/NYM/","title":"NYM"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nContent sourced from: https://nymtech.net/ \n\nExisting internet protocols leak sensitive data that can be used without users knowledge — Nym is developing the infrastructure to prevent this data leakage by protecting every packet’s metadata at the network and application layers.\n\n[DOWNLOAD NYM](https://nymtech.net/download/)[JOIN TELEGRAM](https://t.me/nymchan)\n\n## You should not have to worry about surveillance.\n\nPrivacy should simply be the default of the internet. But the way the internet operates today, the consequences of surveillance threaten all of us, from stolen funds and identities to profiling and human rights violations.\n\n## Use Nym to get network level privacy.\n\nNym protects even against the most powerful, passive adversaries that can observe every packet going in and out of your internet connection. With Nym, you can use the internet without fear of being watched.\n\n### Key Highlights\n\n**Nym protects privacy at the network layer** by encrypting and relaying your internet traffic through a multi-layered network called a mixnet. In each layer of the mixnet, mix nodes mix your internet traffic with that of other users, making communications private and hiding your metadata (IP address, who you talk to, when and where, and more).\n\n**The Nym mixnet is incentivized and decentralized.** Users pay a fee in NYM to send their data through the mixnet. By pledging an initial bond of NYM, anyone can run a mix node. Node runners are then rewarded in NYM tokens based on good quality of service, doing the work of mixing packets and providing privacy for the end users. This is called ‘proof of mixing,’ similar to how Bitcoin rewards miners for mining new blocks. The reward mechanism enables the mixnet to scale and decentralize.\n\n**Nym can work with any application.** From Bitcoin to ZCash, no current “layer 1” blockchain provides “layer 0 privacy” for the peer-to-peer broadcasts used in every transaction. Nym can provide network-level privacy for any blockchain and other generic applications. From Bitcoin to instant messaging, developers can build their applications on top of Nym for network layer and metadata protection of their users."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/WebCivics Medium Posts/WoT Smart Cities Engineering Digital Twin Things & Ecosystems./","title":"WoT Smart Cities Engineering Digital Twin Things & Ecosystems."},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The nature of computational infrastructure use throughout our societies is rapidly forming a pervasive cyber-twin of our world.\n\nOne of the Ted Talks i find grounding, is the one by [Nicholas Negropont](https://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/) co-founder of the [MIT Media Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab), who presents “A 30-year history of the future”\n\n**An Introduction**\n\nToday, expansive economic opportunities are being pursued to produce cyber infrastructure that provides a copy of all things, places, spaces and systems relating to our world; as to manufacture an array of enterprise solutions. As to provide a grounding basis to my views and related purpose orientated pursuits, i’ve discussed at length many of the critical pillars relating to the needs of natural persons specifically. Yet the purpose for so doing, is not to the exclusion of how societies are otherwise made to work through curated works facilitated by ‘groups’ or [_corpus:_ the Latin word for body, or a “body of people”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History). Therein, the activities, and orchestration of activities relating to groups and group governance frameworks is increasingly becoming an interwoven part of how environments are forming interfaces with the web.\n\nThe emergent terms used to define these project & solution types includes environmental Infrastructure; such as ‘smart’ cities, houses & things; which in-turn relates to smart services, interfaces and assistants. Augmented reality devices are amongst the easiest to illustrate;\n\nWhilst this particular example of emergent ‘naturalised interfaces’ can in-turn support considerations to be made in association to the broad array of dystopian visions provided by works such as [Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror) and as a quick example; the short-film called HYPER-REALITY by [Keiichi Matsuda](http://km.cx/).\n\nThe future of naturalised interfaces isn’t simple by any stretch of the imagination as the pervasive utility of informatics systems in society for all sorts of reasons, by all sorts of agents enabling all sorts of things, societal functions, interactions and capacities to support societal governance; is in-turn all wound-up in the objective scopes of work being undertaken, as to bring about these smart — externalised (not personally internalised) systems.\n\nThe obvious reason why this occurs in this way, is that it is far easier to sell and therefore obtain gainful income & employment to build ‘smart cities’ and to form the socio-economic infrastructure required to make them work.\n\nThis article will attempt to canvas some of the high-level factors relating to this industrious field of technological growth; and in-turn, relate that back to how it is a ‘human centric web’ version, can significantly improve those works.\n\n**The Digital Twin movement**\n\n[Digital Twin YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVS-AuSjpOQ&list=PLCbmz0VSZ_voC-usCL7w1rB9UTqcJ63sT&index=2&t=1s)\n\nThe recently discovered term ‘[Digital Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin)’ provides a simple term to illustrate a set of complex and pragmatic production processes. In 2016 Reese Jones spoke about the concept as it relates to natural persons.\n\nWhilst this perspective has been considered in many of my other articles; more broadly, the term ‘digital twin’ is used to describe a means to produce useful interfaces and management platforms for infrastructure projects.\n\n**Smart Environments & a shift, away from traditional ‘cloud computing’**\n\nThe **Smart Cities** movement and related activity streams; seek to improve and engender support for informatics systems in connection to environments.\n\nSmart Cities in-turn encapsulate a broad-array of environmental considerations; as do in-turn relate to an array of real-world implications, for all people who have some form of direct or indirect relationship to any part of them. In-turn both internal (buildings) and external environments are being updated to support a ‘smart environments’ approach.\n\nConsiderations are not simply about environments outside of our homes.\n\nand; As to provide some additional ‘smart home’ visions;\n\nThese ‘smart environments’ are made to work through the implementation of software defined informatics environments, built upon computational infrastructure in addition to networking and authentication systems.\n\n**Impacts upon ‘Cloud Computing’ infrastructure**\n\nInterwoven into this field of industrial activity and technological advancement, the manifest way through which online services are made to work is going to be influenced; with or without support for a ‘human centric web’. Peter Levine, Partner of [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com) speaks about the impact ‘internet of things’ will have on the future of cloud computing.\n\n**IMPLICATIONS**\n\nAs illustrated above, the implementation of infrastructure frameworks that incorporate “Internet of Thing” capabilities and supporting ecosystems; are now very well advanced. However the vast majority of these systems are not able to support informatics systems that support ‘_inforg infrastructure_’, relating to natural persons; as it doesn’t currently exist, and even if a movement to bring it about led to significant investment in the near term; designs and implementations today, would need to consider how it could be that the underlying business systems in addition to software infrastructure, could support it.\n\n> The implications of not doing so; is thought to have a significant causal impact on the future of societies and moreover, humanity.\n\nA series of related issues include;\n\n-   Security of IoT Infrastructure\n-   API designs and Service Infrastructure relating to ‘things’.\n-   Regulatory frameworks; and related issues.\n\nThe means to bring about technological support for human agency and custodianship; whereby a natural person principally ‘owns’ their ‘_digital twin_’, requires a series of complex considerations that are interlinked; as the Articles produced and made available via the [Medium WebCivics publication](https://medium.com/webcivics), seeks to communicate as a series of constituents (of which, this is one).\n\nIn-order to remedy and provide flexibility in relation to IoT infrastructure; there are a set of tools, that are intended to be used with the ‘Permissive Commons’ approach previously illustrated.\n\nWhereas today’s IoT infrastructure generally binds a device to a service provider, who in-turn requires an account (and cloud service) to be created and used; as to enable the device to be useful at all; the implications of this approach is considered to have an array of significant limitations.\n\nThe ‘Human Centric’ approach; makes use of semantic web standards, in a specified way or moreover; a particular ‘business systems approach’, that is then, in-turn, able to support Internet of Things via Web of Things tools; that are in-turn able to be more flexibly supported through the use of tooling, that relates to the Tim Berners-Lee led project Solid, those similar to it; and namely therein Semantic Web Stack tooling alongside TLS (WebID-TLS).\n\n**Introducing, Web of Things.**\n\nThe ‘Web of Things’ solutions framework decouples the device functionality from any vendor specific application or software interface. It achieves this through the use of Ontologies that can generically describe a thing; such as the functional qualities of a light-switch.\n\nBen Francis from Mozilla [first demonstrates this in 2017](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/building-the-web-of-things/) and has continued to [post blog articles about Web of Things with Mozilla](https://hacks.mozilla.org/category/web-of-things/), since.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0EPZjl8nTweqZAfu8UE7ew.png)\n\n[Web of Things W3C Standards](https://webofthings.org/standards/)\n\nWhilst the approach considered by my articles in-effect update aspects to the published specifications for Web of Things; as to incorporate the use of DIDs & ‘permissive commons’ infrastructure alongside authentication tools such as WebID-TLS (and indirectly also WebID-OIDC); the considerations date back to 2013; whereby my early examples of ‘[knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99)’ related [functional considerations](http://mediaprophet.org/ux_KB/) illustrated the concept of device management.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZUcAtd78nC_ljubpaniVpg.png)\n\n[device management: earlier ‘knowledge banking’ works.](http://mediaprophet.org/ux_KB/page4115294.html)\n\nTherein; as to illustrate the considerations, amongst the more easily illustrated tools to support ‘human centric’ informatics in relation to systems; I will illustrate how [WebID-TLS](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/WebID/raw-file/tip/spec/tls-respec.html) to describe how this might be made to work.\n\nA WebID-TLS certificate is generated on a device that in-turn burns into the devices TLS certificate; a semantically notated URI about an agent, that is called a [WebID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebID). WebID’s are in-turn used with Authentication methods; such as WebID-OIDC, WebID-TLS amongst others; noting therein, [https://graph.facebook.com/me](https://graph.facebook.com/me) provides an example of existing an WebID.\n\nThereafter; whilst WebID-TLS documentation speaks more specifically about;\n\n-   Agent:Person — there is both some disagreement about the semantics of a WebID approach; and, whether/how distinctions are made between ‘things’ and accounts used with them to denote natural persons;\n\nThe methodology i have preferentially sought to achieve employs multiple WebIDs as to authenticate the user independent to the device. This methodology is sought to be employed as to support flexibly well-defined semantics, and related use-case & interoperability support requirements.\n\n-   FOAF: this is an optional statement that is otherwise poorly declared.\n\nThe primary requirement for the WebID-[auth] URI is that it provides an RDF formatted document as to support semantic (machine-readable) functionality.\n\n-   HTTP: now DIDs provide improved flexibility\n\nTherein; the consideration is that, ontological frameworks supported by way of permissive commons infrastructure, is then able to support private interactions with ‘smart environments’ through the use of ‘inforg’ apparatus; alongside similarly produced apparatus serving the needs of infrstructure custodians / owners; and their business systems.\n\nIoT devices would be deployed in relation to a Named (Legal) Entity; who would be responsible for the operation of that ‘thing’, which is in-turn rendered interfaces that support the use of it by others, as defined entities or defined ‘groups’; who are in-turn able to interact with ‘things’ via semantics curating authoritative permissions and pre-defined credential requests, that are governed by legal stakeholders who have defined relationships with the environments.\n\nThe device interactivity from a functional level, is then rendered means for support by way of ontological frameworks and defined vocabulary. This vocabulary can in-turn be used with naturalised interfaces, such as voice or sensor prompted cues; and can support security requirements by pointing at pseudo-anonymous URIs relating to identifiable persons; that may in-turn be employed to support a law-enforcement request as to legally identify a person.\n\nWith respect to semantics and voice; due to semantic inferencing, services are able to do such things as translate requests from one language, to another.\n\nWhere systems relate to Network Authentication; WebID-TLS certificates on ‘things’ such as mobile devices (or smart cars) can improve support for transparent authentication, communications security (inc. DNS over TLS) whilst supporting safety and security requirements; by utilising _Inforgs_.\n\n**Implications for Naturalised Interfaces**\n\nWhat are naturalised interfaces?\n\nThe term ‘naturalised interfaces’ i found in [this long video from 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvhW8cp15tk) of a talk with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. In-effect, the concept is that there are many new ways to interact with computing devices; ranging from new types of devices, through to new ways to interact with devices, many of which employ biometrics of some form.\n\nThe Implications of naturalised interfaces therefore hinges upon the capacity for information systems to be made able to make use of them. Where this relates to such things as biometrics, there are an enormous amount of privacy related considerations (moreover therein ‘dignity’) involved. The Principle differences embodied in the ‘human centric’ approach, is that these personal informatics relating to a natural persons ‘digital twin’ and the informatics systems that denote and relate to; how a natural person makes use of identifiers relating to them; to interacts with any other agent, in the human centric web approach; is made possible & available via the persons inforg, rather than necessarily requiring those capabilities for every other system.\n\n> As is considered in my article [Comms & Security: ‘dignity vs. privacy’](https://medium.com/webcivics/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0) (alongside [the others](https://medium.com/webcivics)) there are many integrally important constituent considerations that relate to the differences between systems that incorporate support for natural persons; as is distinct and somewhat unobtainable to those that don’t. Additional benefits also include improved functional characteristics, as the ‘deep learning’ (AI training) capabilities brought about for biometric services in relation to the person; becomes a built-in capability enhancement function, by the inforg processes the personally attributable training data; with privacy considerations, built into core business systems.\n\n_Thereafter; as is made usefully available for 3rd party systems & services,_\n\nThe principle differentiation between this informatics model and those currently employed for IoT generally; is that the informatics models seperate the informatics frameworks relating to natural persons from the institutional provider of an IoT related product, service or broader ecosystem of services.\n\n> As such, the biometric identifiers relating to a natural person do not need to be provided to IoT manufacturers or related providers; as the inforg environment is designed to service those informatics needs.\n\n**Improving Business Systems flexibility**\n\nCompanies, institutional and social stakeholders do not need to design their systems as to acquire and internally service all of the business systems requirements; via a particular vendor or software platform provider.\n\nRather, the informatics standards built upon Semantic Web technology based infrastructure, decouples devices from their vendors; as to provide meaningful beneficial ownership and control, with security (inc. privacy) considerations built in.\n\n> This in-turn impacts all societal systems that form computational relationships with natural persons; or in other words, all IoT related tools.\n\n**A Few illustrative Examples**\n\n**The Household TV.**\n\nWhilst advanced internet and hybrid tv services now require a ‘log-in’ with the provider, this in-turn connects a specified user of that device, with an online account tracking (and making use of) the information collected in relation to the use of that device.\n\n_This can lead to many unintended consequences._\n\nShould the TV be supported by way of a WebID-TLS Certificate (as is supported by [HbbTV standards](https://www.hbbtv.org/), amongst other things); then, the use of the device can be made semantically distinct to the users of it.\n\n**Commercial Environments**\n\nWhere this relates to corporate systems & offices; semantics can be employed to link a calendar event, with the means to authenticate access to the office & building; alongside any infrastructure made available in it for use in connection to the meeting.\n\n> Where this relates to public services; such as maintenance, semantics provide the ability to qualify whether the individual service provider is suitable for the job, as to enable consideration of relevant checks; such as trade certifications, of proof of age (over 18) check; alongside safety checks such as; a ‘[working with children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_With_Children_Check)’ or a police check; or the means to identify which adult is associated to; a child lost in a shopping centre, or provide the means to enable alerts, before the child is even found to by lost, by others in some public place.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nApproaches that make use of the human centric infrastructure; facilitating the _means_ to incorporate semantics that incorporate considerations of human actors; provide a capacity for governance informatics systems to make use of ‘human centric’ ‘trusted data services’, without necessarily requiring all the details of all person, for all stakeholders, as a consequence of design issues.\n\nSemantically permissive frameworks provide a series of accountability supportive, ecosystems tools; that can be made _permissively available,_ as to be _put to work_ through a trusted ecosystems approach that provides an array of new opportunities through the industrial creation of interoperable constituent parts.\n\nConversely; Without the means for infrastructure services to support the needs of natural persons / civilians, the cost to deploy new infrastructure services increases.\n\n> Alternatively provided ‘proprietary APIs’ can lead to additional expense; poor functionality and worsened potential issues for addressing security concerns.\n\nMany of the functional capacities thought to be usefully applied in a human centric web approach; could be applied through the use of commercial alternatives provided by a select few from [the largest 100 websites in the world](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranking-the-top-100-websites-in-the-world/); whilst others from that list, may in-fact be amongst those who first bring to market, a human centric web alternative. Indeed the technical differences between the approach communicated in my articles, vs the capabilities that could easily be provided near-term by many of those sites; is largely, on a technical basis, is of an inconsequential nature to deliver.\n\nTo deliver an alternative that makes use of the ‘human centric’ opportunities illustrated; requires far more work, by comparison to its competitors."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/Semantic Web/Ontologies/SKOS/","title":"SKOS"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-skos-reference-20080829/skos.html\n\nSKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) is a standard for representing and sharing knowledge organization systems (KOS) on the web.

Those involved, have extrodinary skills and expertise in a variety of areas, which are in-turn associated with roles of significance internationally via various venues.  \n\nIt is my hope that members of this group may usefully contribute when it is appropriate to do so.  in the meantime, this document will seek to provide some relatively basic information.\n\n### Chat GPT\n\n> Q: How would you define the science of consiousness?\n\n*The science of consciousness is the study of the nature of consciousness, or the subjective experience of being aware of one's thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws on research and theories from a range of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science.*\n\n*In the science of consciousness, researchers aim to understand the neural basis of consciousness, the relationship between the brain and consciousness, and the ways in which consciousness arises and evolves. They also study the various forms of consciousness that exist, such as wakefulness, sleep, and altered states of consciousness, and the ways in which consciousness can be altered or influenced by external factors.*\n\n*The science of consciousness is a complex and difficult field, and there is still much that is not understood about the nature of consciousness. However, advances in neuroscience and other fields have led to a greater understanding of the neural basis of consciousness, and researchers continue to make progress in understanding the nature of this elusive and fundamental aspect of human experience.*\n\n### Ontology and Human Dignity\n\nWhilst it is important to understand the intended meaning of ontologies, as does relate to a particular set of tooling that provides a particular series of practical capabilities.  This does in-turn relate also to [[Understanding Ontologies]] more broadly. \n\nIn relation to the designs of [[Semantic Web]] [[Ontologies]] the vast majority of ontologies are built on-top of [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) family of ontologies, whereby the modern version is [OWL 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/).  These ontologies are built into many of the leading Semantic Web Ontology tools, and whilst not mandatory - it is difficult to create alternatives other than via manual means - as least, that's been my experience so far.  The Top Level concept in OWL is 'Thing'; and whilst this is usefully applied to every `owl:thing` the appropriateness of employing this term to provide support for [[Human Centric AI]] and  [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]] which thereby also needs to figure out how to describe aspects relating to [[Human Consciousness]] in a manner that is not sought to be described in a way whereby a `owl:thing` may have a possessive relationship over natural persons, is fairly critical to the requirements for the [[The Values Project]] and related semantics.\n\nThis field of work is enormously complex; and discussions about it in good faith, often leads to difficulties that are fundamental to a persons own sense of being; which whilst sought to be rendered support in ways that are morally appropriate, the broader implications are often poorly understood generally; and there is some discussion about the sorts of implications that are sought to be addressed in the document about [[Social Attack Vectors]].\n\nThe broader belief is, that the ability to address these sorts of very complex issues will only really become more pragmatically feasible once [[Webizen 3.0]] is employable with [[Webizen Apps]] that can support such things as [[HyperMedia Containers]] that enable persons whose skills are remarkable; but that they're expertise is not in developing modern computer software; more specifically, as a software programmer. \n\nAnother part of the means through which this important are of consideration is sought to be addressed in manner that should minimally improve upon the circumstances of how AI (online platforms) work today; will be emboided in the [[Ontologies]] and [[Permissive Commons Tech]] related works (inclusive to: [[Temporal Semantics]] ); and, the information provided about that work will help to inform how i will update and improve this document, in future.\n\nIn the meangtime; i've asked [OpenGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) / OpenAI for its point of view; per below,\n\n##### OpenAi \n\n> Q: *Define what is a personal ontology - as does relate to the use of AI and the nature of how a human being is defined both by themselves and their environment, including socio-economic influences*\n\n*A: A personal ontology is an individual's understanding of the nature of reality and the concepts that exist within it. It reflects an individual's beliefs, values, and assumptions about the world and their place within it, and it is shaped by their personal experiences, cultural and social context, and education.*\n\n*Personal ontologies can be complex and multifaceted, and they can vary significantly from person to person. They can also change and evolve over time as an individual's experiences and understanding of the world changes.*\n\n*In the context of AI, personal ontologies can be relevant in several ways. For example, an AI system that is designed to interact with humans may need to take into account the personal ontologies of its users in order to effectively communicate and understand their needs and preferences. In addition, the design of an AI system may be influenced by the personal ontologies of the designers, reflecting their values and assumptions about the world and the role of AI in it.*\n\n*Socio-economic influences can also shape personal ontologies, as an individual's economic and social status can shape their experiences and understanding of the world. For example, an individual's personal ontology may be influenced by their socio-economic background, their education, and the social and cultural norms that they are exposed to. Understanding these influences can be important for designing AI systems that are fair and unbiased, and that are able to effectively serve the needs of a diverse user base.*\n\n*It is also worth noting that personal ontologies can sometimes come into conflict with each other, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts. For example, two individuals with different personal ontologies may have different beliefs or assumptions about the nature of reality, leading to difficulties in communication and understanding.*\n\n*In the context of AI, it is important for designers and users to be aware of these potential conflicts and to take steps to address them. This can include designing AI systems that are able to adapt to and accommodate different personal ontologies, and engaging in dialogue and communication to build shared understanding and resolve misunderstandings.*\n\n*Overall, personal ontologies are an important aspect of human experience and understanding, and they can have significant implications for the design and use of AI systems. It is important for designers and users to be aware of personal ontologies and to consider them in the design and use of AI systems in order to ensure that they are effective and fair.*\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Permissive Commons/Requirements/Engineering Considerations/Temporal Semantics/","title":"Temporal Semantics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Temporal semantics is a branch of semantics that deals with the study of time and its relation to language and meaning. It is concerned with how time is expressed, interpreted, and understood in natural languages, and with the ways in which time affects the interpretation of words, sentences, and texts.\n\nTemporal semantics is an important area of research in linguistics, philosophy, computer science, and other fields. It has a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation, and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn natural language, time can be expressed in many different ways, including through words, phrases, and grammatical constructions that denote past, present, and future events. Temporal semantics is concerned with understanding how these expressions are used to convey temporal information, and with the ways in which this information can be interpreted and used by speakers and listeners.\n\nIn addition to studying the temporal aspects of natural language, temporal semantics also investigates the ways in which time is represented and manipulated in computational systems, such as database systems, knowledge bases, and artificial intelligence systems. It is concerned with developing formal models and methods for representing and reasoning about time in these systems, and with the ways in which these models and methods can be used to support a wide range of applications.\n\nThe use of 'Temporal Semantics' is critical to the entire ecosystem; and one of many related objectives include employing the techniques to address [Social Attack Vectors](Social%20Attack%20Vectors.md) that employ temporal factors as part of the attack method; alongside, an array of happier purposes for providing support for temporal semantics.\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols #RuleOfLaw "},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/ESG/Biosphere Calcs/","title":"Biosphere Calcs"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Concept of adding the Biosphere Calcs is an attempt to consider the Biosphere related implications of a product, service or process. \n\nVarious ontologies will be used to create Machine Readable Ontologies that describe the biosphere relationships to various sorts of activities and things, which in-turn also relates to [[Energy Calcs]], but not exclusively. \n\nThere are various [[Non-Financial Currencies]] related considerations that have material relationships with the relationship between agents and our biosphere.  \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/ESG/Energy Calcs/","title":"Energy Calcs"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Energy Caculations are thought to be a critical part of the broader [[Biosphere Ontologies]] although considered to be distinct from other broader [[Biosphere Calcs]], whilst still playing a vital role with [[Sustainable Development Goals (ESG)]] and other related broader metrics. \n\nVarious forms of [[Non-Financial Currencies]], including but not limited to Carbon related metrics, fundamentally relate to the energy lifecycle costs associated to the production, consumption and an array of other factors associated to the use of things, and other broader forms of activities. \n\nTherein; the means to consider some of the broader ecosystems include methodologies that include but are not exclusive to,\n\n> 'Cradle-to-grave' assessment considers impacts at each stage of a product's life-cycle, from the time natural resources are extracted from the ground and processed through each subsequent stage of manufacturing, transportation, product use, and ultimately, disposal.\n   Source: [European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/glossary/eea-glossary/cradle-to-grave)\n\n\n> Cradle to Cradle (C2C) is about seeing garbage as an eternal resource and doing the right thing from the beginning.

Whilst the webizen environment is being designed to support the abiity for people to own their own 'Webizen', there are still components that need to be operated on the network, most likely via some sort of infrastructure solution that's being provided via ICT Operating in a Data Centre somewhere.  This \"Head End\" or gateway counterpart; is intended to be made available in a way that means Webizen Owners can set one up themselves.  Nonetheless, the webizen protocols feature an array of [[Values Credentials]] that may in-turn lead to a user wanting to migrate their entire environment to some alternative system. \n\nSo, whilst the qualities of how these systems work is very different to the way Web 2.0 apps work; there are still a series of requirements, both in seeking to obtain information from legacy systems, and also to support the needs of a user should they want to migrate.\n\nThe [Data Portability Project](https://datatransferproject.dev/) whose Current Contributors include Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, SmugMug and Twitter is an example, and the GitHub Repo for it is: [google/data-transfer-project](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project) \n\nMost other platforms have some sort of API and/or Export function, and there is a means to write software that can provide either or both; the means to transfer information to a webizen platform in future, or alterantively interact with the external platform via an API.\n\n## Solid & Similar\n\n[Solid](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) is the name of a critical foundational body of work that relates to the historical Webizen related body of works both by W3C related Communities, involving also myself (Web Civics / Trust Factory; knowledgebanking, etc) body of works. \n\nThese works also involved various other W3C Community efforts (projects); whereby the intended purpose, was to end-up with the tools required to create an ecosystem, that was supported by open-standards (w3c, ietf, etc). \n\nSolid is now led by [Inrupt](https://www.inrupt.com/) which was co-founded by the Inventor of the World-Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee,  He is presently working towards a [W3C Solid Working Group](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-solid/2022Nov/0001.html)\n\nI celebrate the significance of the attention TimBL has prioritised towards these efforts.  It was certainly the case earlier, that progress was impossible and indeed very dangerous, as such his commitment towards progressing this work; has led to progress that wouldn't have occurred otherwise.\n\nYet, For reasons i would prefer not to discuss fully publically (seems inappropriate), the Webizen Project is seemingly quite different to what it is that they've been working to create.\n\nNonetheless; part of the objectives, as to support the safety protocols requirements; should be to seek to ensure owners of webizen systems can migrate to something else that can provide the highest level of compatibility or similar features, as is possible.  This is both a moral requirement as well as it being a practical requirement. \n\nThe Webizen Ecosystems has an array of Values Frameworks, which are sought to be enforcable.  This may mean that a person who is shown to have acted in a way that invokes the need to act as to protect the rights of others in a way that is considered extremely serious; and ideally also, as should in-turn be made able to be considered by a court of law; then, the consequences may be that the [[Temporal Semantics]] are considered negative to an extent whereby the webizen owner wants to migrate away, to a system that may in-turn support different Values (ie: an environment that does not support [[Values Credentials]]).\n\nAs such, Whilst there are an array of very difficult considerations that need to be worked through as a [[Web Science]] problem, the underlying belief is that the closest technical solution; is likely to be related to the [Solid Specifications](https://solidproject.org/specification) and in-turn [solid protocol](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) which needs to be supported for interoperability purposes anyway. \n\nFrom an Artificial Intelligence perspective, a means for people to migrate needs to be considered.  the options to achieve these sorts of outcomes, have not been evaluated yet.\n\nIt is expected that there will be an array of qualities that the Webizen & Web Civics Ecosystems will offer, that are not otherwise available.  Whilst it is likely that the creation of a solution will invoke a market of competitors creating similar works; it is still likely to be the case that there will be significant differences.  \n\n### 3rd Party Rights\n\nThe means to ensure that a person, regardless of their circumstances, are able to migrate; should not disaffect or cause injury to others.  This needs to be considered also, as there are various consequences that are not purely about 'data portability', but rather social informatics more broadly.  \n\n## Enforcability of Rules\n\nWhilst very best efforts are being made to seek to ensure that the environment addresses [[Social Attack Vectors]] and other threats that may otherwise cause harm to persons in a manner that is unfair; part of what is required to achieve these sorts of outcomes, is, at the end of the day - the ability for a [[The Webizen Charter]], [[Webizen Alliance]] member to boot a person off their system and cease to provide any support or assistance for that entity.  \n\nWhilst this does not mean that a provider has any right to decide any lawful punishment that may apply to the subject of any such form of action; and whilst any judgement made by an appropriate legal tribunal and/or court of law (or indeed also via legislature); there is also an array of obligations that are built into the webizen ecosystem which require stewards (alliance charter / webizen alliance members / values-credentials related agents) to process and consequentially address.  If the consequences of those circumstances results in an outcome that means the data-subject is excommunicated; then, they still need to be provided the means to have somewhere else to go. \n\nThere are also an array of Ontological Notations that are necessarily produced, as to provide an  [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] that will be rendered against [[Temporal Semantics]] and ensure any disaffected parties may take any further disputes to a court of law for review and/or lawful determinations in relation to the circumstances, etc.\n\nObjectively, this is not the sort of event that is sought to occur; however, there are circumstances where the nature of a persons actions is of a kind, that requires action and most often these circumstances would also invoke a situation where reporting a matter to an appropriate law enforcement body should be part of the procedural processes employed by [[Webizen Alliance]] members.  However, it is not always the case that situations of a serious nature end-up being investigated or appropriately investigated; in which case, the consequence of on-going harms that may otherwise occur is not considered to be supportive of any factors relating to the [[Commercial Models]] including but not limited to [[ESG]] considerations, and it is important that there is a right to act; and to seek to form [[Social Factors]] related considerations about how to address complex issues in a proportionate and responsible manner..  These sorts of works are complex and will require time and expertise of various persons, which is in-turn only reasonably able to occur after the [[Webizen 3.0]] solutions are operationally in-place.  An interim solution will be required before that occurs.\n\n### Data Formats\n\nMost of the data-systems are designed using Semantic Web technologies; or in other words, its put together using an ecosystem of open-standards in a specified manner, to create something new.  Nonetheless, the underlying data (semantic web structures, etc.) can, somewhat easily, be exported in formats that can be usefully employed by other 'apps'; but, the ecosystems solution characteristics, aren't simply about the data-format of the data only.\n\nTo Some-Degree, attempting to migrate away from the webizen environment, may become as difficult as seeking to migrate away from the use of [[Internet]] where there is no alternative that performs a similar sort of function (yet - noting the future for Blockchains, is unknown).  \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/Safety Protocols/Ending Digital Slavery/","title":"Ending Digital Slavery"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nWhen asking ChatAI about Ending digital Slavery, it provided the following feedback;\n\nThere are a few different economic models that might be better suited to addressing the issue of unpaid or underpaid work, especially when it comes to knowledge workers. One approach could be to adopt a model that places a greater emphasis on workers' rights and the fair distribution of wealth. This could involve implementing policies that aim to reduce income inequality and provide a safety net for workers who are not being fairly compensated for their labor. Additionally, there could be a focus on providing training and education opportunities to help workers develop the skills they need to negotiate for better pay and working conditions. This could be coupled with stronger labor protections and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that workers are not exploited.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that should be avoided in order to end digital slavery, including:\n\n1.  Exploitative working conditions: Employers should ensure that workers are not subjected to excessive or unreasonable workloads, and that they are provided with fair pay and benefits.\n    \n2.  Forced labor: Employers should not use threats, intimidation, or coercion to force workers to perform labor against their will.\n    \n3.  Lack of worker protections: Employers should provide workers with adequate protections, including safety equipment and training, to prevent accidents or injuries on the job.\n    \n4.  Discrimination: Employers should not discriminate against workers on the basis of their race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Employers should have policies in place to prevent and address harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace.\n    \n6.  Lack of transparency: Employers should be transparent about their labor practices and should allow workers to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nThe principles for ending digital slavery can also be applied to open-source projects done online cooperatively with others. For example, it is important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are not subjected to exploitation or forced labor. This means that they should not be asked to work excessive hours or be paid unfairly for their contributions.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are treated fairly and with respect, and that there is no discrimination or harassment. This may involve having clear policies in place to address these issues and providing a safe and inclusive environment for all contributors.\n\nTransparency is also important in open-source projects. Contributors should be aware of the terms and conditions under which they are working, and should be able to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nOverall, it is important to recognize that the contributions of open-source volunteers are valuable and should be treated with respect and fairness. By following these principles, open-source projects can be more inclusive and sustainable in the long term.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/Safety Protocols/Fair Work Protocols/","title":"Fair Work Protocols"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nThe Development of Fair Work Protocols, is an essential component to producing any solution that has any capacity whatsoever for [[Ending Digital Slavery]].\n\nThe Considerations relate to a problem that is fundamentally very old, and indeed also quite complex.  In consideration, a lens of considering the past - in particular, the 8 hour movement and related historical contexts are thought useful when considering how a means to address these sorts of complex problems, might be addressed. \n\n### About the 8-Hour Movement\nThe [8-hour movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day) was a labor movement that sought to improve working conditions and protect the rights of workers by advocating for the reduction of the workday to 8 hours. The movement emerged in the late 19th century, at a time when many workers were subjected to long and grueling workdays, often working 12 hours or more per day.\n\nThe 8-hour movement argued that reducing the workday to 8 hours would improve the health and well-being of workers, as well as increase productivity and efficiency. The movement used a variety of tactics to promote its goals, including strikes, boycotts, and lobbying efforts.\n\nThe 8-hour movement was successful in achieving many of its goals. In many countries, labor laws were enacted that set limits on the length of the workday and established the right to overtime pay for work beyond 8 hours per day. In the United States, the 8-hour movement played a key role in the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the 40-hour workweek and established the right to overtime pay for work beyond 40 hours per week.\n\nOverall, the 8-hour movement was a significant force in the fight for workers' rights and helped to improve the working conditions and well-being of millions of workers around the world.\n\nActivities that are a form of work are those that are performed for the purpose of earning a living or producing goods or services. These activities may involve physical or mental labor and may be performed for an employer or as self-employment. Examples of work activities include:\n\n1.  Manufacturing goods\n2.  Providing services, such as consulting or healthcare\n3.  Teaching or lecturing\n4.  Performing research\n5.  Writing or creating content\n6.  Sales or marketing\n7.  Managing a business\n\nWork activities are typically distinguished from recreation and sleep activities in that they are undertaken for the purpose of earning a living or producing goods or services, rather than for leisure or relaxation. However, it is important to note that what is considered work may vary depending on cultural and societal context, and some activities that are considered work in one context may be considered recreation in another.\n\nThe principles of the 8-hour movement, which sought to improve working conditions and protect the rights of workers in the industrial era, can be rejuvenated and applied to knowledge work in a number of ways. Some potential approaches could include:\n\n1.  Adjusting the focus: Rather than focusing solely on the number of hours worked, the principles of the 8-hour movement could be adapted to address issues specific to knowledge work, such as the need for flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance.\n    \n2.  Strengthening worker protections: Knowledge workers may not have the same level of legal protections as traditional workers, such as the right to unionize or the protection of labor laws. Policymakers and advocacy groups could work to strengthen protections for knowledge workers, such as by establishing new regulations or extending existing protections to cover this group.\n    \n3.  Promoting fair compensation: Knowledge work can often be highly skilled and specialized, and knowledge workers may be entitled to fair compensation for their contributions. Advocacy groups and policymakers could work to promote fair compensation for knowledge work, such as by establishing guidelines or standards for fair pay.\n    \n4.  Supporting education and training: The principles of the 8-hour movement could also be rejuvenated by supporting education and training programs that help knowledge workers to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their careers. This could include initiatives to promote lifelong learning and provide access to educational opportunities for knowledge workers.\n    \n\n### Forming an applied Methodology for Knowledge Workers\nThere are many ways that the principles of the 8-hour movement could be rejuvenated and applied to knowledge work in order to support the rights and well-being of knowledge workers. By adjusting the focus to address the specific needs of knowledge workers, strengthening worker protections, promoting fair compensation, and supporting education and training, it is possible to create a more supportive and fair environment for knowledge work. This can help to ensure that knowledge workers are able to contribute their skills and expertise to society, while also being able to enjoy a high quality of life and work-life balance.\n\nThe nature of the concept of time spent engaged in work, recreation, and sleep activities for knowledge workers may differ from that of traditional workers in a number of ways. Some potential differences could include:\n\n1.  Flexibility: Knowledge work often requires a high level of flexibility, as knowledge workers may need to be able to adapt to changing demands and priorities. This may involve working outside of traditional business hours or working from different locations.\n    \n2.  Autonomy: Knowledge workers may also have a higher level of autonomy, as they may be responsible for managing their own work schedules and priorities. This can allow for greater control over the balance between work, recreation, and sleep activities.\n    \n3.  Boundaries: The boundaries between work, recreation, and sleep may be less clear for knowledge workers, as they may be required to be available and responsive to work-related demands outside of traditional business hours. This can make it more difficult to maintain a healthy balance between these activities.\n    \n\nThe nature of the concept of time spent engaged in work, recreation, and sleep activities for knowledge workers may be more flexible and autonomous than for traditional workers, but it may also involve a greater challenge in maintaining a healthy balance between these activities.\n\nPaying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their time spent doing work is important for a number of reasons:\n\n1.  Fair compensation: Knowledge work can often be highly skilled and specialized, and knowledge workers may be entitled to fair compensation for their contributions. Paying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their work can help to ensure that they are fairly compensated for their efforts and expertise.\n    \n2.  Motivation and retention: Fair compensation can also be important for motivating and retaining knowledge workers. If knowledge workers feel that they are not being fairly compensated for their work, they may be less motivated to perform at their best or may be more likely to leave for other opportunities.\n    \n3.  Intellectual property rights: Payment can also help to respect the intellectual property rights of knowledge workers. If knowledge workers are not compensated for their useful works, they may not have the financial resources to enforce their intellectual property rights or may be less likely to assert their rights in the face of potential exploitation.\n    \n\n#### Building an Equitable Future for Creators\n\nPaying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their work is important for ensuring that they are fairly compensated, motivated, and able to assert their intellectual property rights. This can help to create a more supportive and fair environment for knowledge work, which can benefit both knowledge workers and society as a whole.\n\nIncome is often closely related to a person's ability to keep themselves safe, as having a steady and sufficient source of income can provide access to a range of resources and protections that can help to ensure safety and security.\n\nFor example, having a sufficient income can allow a person to afford basic necessities such as food, shelter, and medical care, which can help to ensure physical safety and well-being. Income can also provide access to financial resources that can be used to protect against financial risks, such as the ability to afford insurance or save for emergencies.\n\nIn addition, income can often be used to purchase goods and services that can help to ensure safety, such as security systems or emergency services. Having a sufficient income can also allow a person to afford legal representation or other forms of advocacy, which can be important for protecting their rights and interests.\n\nincome is often closely related to a person's ability to keep themselves safe, as it provides access to a range of resources and protections that can help to ensure safety and security.\n\n\n### Relationship to Web Science Tasks\n\nThere are a number of web science questions that could be investigated in order to support the development of fair work protocols for knowledge workers. Some potential areas of investigation could include:\n\n1.  Workflow and productivity: Web science research could explore how different workflows and technologies impact the productivity and well-being of knowledge workers. This could include studying the effects of remote work, flexible work schedules, and collaborative tools on worker outcomes.\n    \n2.  Fair compensation: Web science research could also examine how to design fair compensation systems for knowledge workers, including exploring the use of algorithms and other tools to assess the value of different types of knowledge work.\n    \n3.  Intellectual property rights: Web science research could also explore ways to protect the intellectual property rights of knowledge workers, including studying the effectiveness of different approaches to licensing and copyright.\n    \n4.  Work-life balance: Web science research could examine how to support work-life balance for knowledge workers, including studying the impact of different work environments and policies on worker well-being.\n    \n\nThere are many different web science questions that could be investigated in order to support the development of fair work protocols for knowledge workers. By studying these issues, web science can help to inform the design of policies and practices that support the rights and well-being of knowledge workers.\n\n### ESG Implications \n[[ESG]] (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria can be related to the importance of developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers in a number of ways. For example:\n\n1.  Social criteria: Developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers could be considered a social issue, as it relates to the well-being and rights of workers. Ensuring that knowledge workers are treated fairly and are able to work in a supportive and healthy environment could be seen as a key element of a company's social responsibility.\n    \n2.  Governance criteria: Fair work protocols can also be related to governance criteria, as they can help to ensure that a company is governed in a transparent and accountable manner. Developing and implementing fair work protocols can help to demonstrate a company's commitment to responsible and ethical business practices.\n    \n\nOverall, ESG criteria can be related to the importance of developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers in that they can help to ensure that companies are addressing key social and governance issues and are committed to responsible and ethical business practices. By considering ESG criteria in the development of fair work protocols, companies can help to ensure that they are contributing to a more sustainable and equitable society."},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/Safety Protocols/Freedom of Thought/","title":"Freedom of Thought"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Freedom of thought is the freedom of an individual to hold or consider a fact, opinion, or belief without interference or coercion. It is a fundamental human right that is protected by various national and international laws and agreements, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Freedom of thought allows people to form and express their own beliefs and opinions, and to think and speak freely without fear of reprisal or punishment. It is an essential element of a free and democratic society, as it enables individuals to engage in critical thinking, debate, and the free exchange of ideas. Freedom of thought is often closely connected to other fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press.\n\nThere are a few key measures that are typically required to protect freedom of thought:\n\n1.  Legal protections: Freedom of thought is often protected by national and international laws and agreements that prohibit interference with an individual's right to hold and express their own beliefs and opinions.\n    \n2.  Political will: Governments and other authorities must be committed to protecting freedom of thought and be willing to take action to defend it when it is threatened.\n    \n3.  A robust civil society: A strong and active civil society, including media, NGOs, and other organizations, can help to promote and defend freedom of thought by advocating for the rights of individuals and holding authorities accountable.\n    \n4.  An informed and educated public: An informed and educated public is more likely to support and defend freedom of thought, as they are better equipped to understand the importance of this right and to recognize when it is being threatened.\n    \n5.  A culture of respect and tolerance: A culture that values diversity of thought and encourages respectful dialogue and debate can also help to protect freedom of thought.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that can threaten freedom of thought, including:\n\n1.  Censorship: Governments or other authorities may try to suppress certain ideas or beliefs by censoring information or punishing those who express certain viewpoints.\n    \n2.  Intimidation: Threats, harassment, or violence against those who hold or express certain beliefs can deter people from thinking or speaking freely.\n    \n3.  Propaganda: The use of misleading or biased information to manipulate public opinion or shape people's beliefs can undermine freedom of thought.\n    \n4.  Groupthink: Pressure to conform to the beliefs or opinions of a particular group can discourage independent thought and limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives.\n    \n5.  Lack of access to information: If people do not have access to a wide range of viewpoints and sources of information, they may be limited in their ability to think freely and form their own opinions.\n\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/Safety Protocols/Human Centric AI/","title":"Human Centric AI"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n## Summary\n\nHuman Centric AI refers to the use of [[Cognative AI]] in connection with [[Centricity]] considerations.  \n\nHuman-Centric AI is a term used to describe artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are designed, in consideration of [[Social Factors]] to ensure that AI systems act as tools and not rulers.

Most of the time what these people are talking about is some sort of identity related instrument or what Americans call 'Credentials'.   In some circumstances, particularly within the field of #ICT #Cyber and #Internet what they're talking about is the way people 'log in', and in fields relating to finance they often mean the ability to verify their services are connected to a known entity for legal purposes such as anti-money laundering laws ( #KYCAML ) and similar; and whilst these constituencies relating to persons are very important, they're different to 'human identity' and have both different qualities and different sorts of needs.  \n\nThe Webizen Approach to better rationalising the concept of 'human identity' is a critically important foundational requirement for the entire ecosystem. As such, it is an instrumental part of the [[Safety Protocols]] framework.   Essentially, what the webizen environment does is provides a capacity for software agents to semantically and temporally support agent centric communications and personal stewardship of a persons own life, and therefore / thereby - their #Identity. \n\nThese concepts are somewhat linked with the [[Centricity]] considerations that are part of the informatics design principals.  Therein, whilst 3rd parties will provide [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] they do not in and of themselves define who a human being is; they only provide artifacts related to that instrument and whatever it is says, only reflects the statements made on that verifiable document; it does not in and of itself, define a human being; nor does any private key related to the storage of that #Thing.   The greatest reason why others cannot properly define a person in a way that appropriately defines exactly who that person is; is that, they'd need to know everything about that person, which is not possible for various scientific reasons.  \n\nSo, there's a concept of #Observers which is in-turn dynamic with [[Temporal Semantics]] and what is in-effect a subset of [[Permissive Commons]]. \n\nIn-effect, the #Webizen environment is intended to provide support for #HumanIdentity in a particular way, that means the person is responsible for defining who it is they are, as a consequence of their actions - of what they do, what they don't do, etc.  \n\nThis is then stored in a way that provides the owner of a #Webizen to manage their identity and in-turn also, their [[Relationships (Social)]].  These considerations are being assembled into useful tools that seek to have the effect of protecting  [[Freedom of Thought]] and in-turn also address issues of significance, such as [[Ending Digital Slavery]].  To achieve this, foundational requirements such as [[The Values Project]] works to create an #AI environment that is able to support complex technology related requirements.  \n\nIn-turn, these systems are intended to support a methodology where Webizen Owners, have the tools they need to be the primary steward of their own lives, and in-turn support also the means for those persons to both; protect themselves and their loved ones (including children & other dependants) from harms that the architecture of how information systems work today, enable and in-turn provide economic support for both enabling and processing [[Currencies]] gainfully by exploiters, at great cost.\n\nEarlier documents about this include; but are not exclusive to,\n\nThe 2018 webizen.net.au files; \n- [[social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles]] \n- [[socioeconomic-relations-p1]]\n- [[personal-augmentation-of-ai]]\n- [[preserving-the-freedom-to-think]]\n- [[Social Encryption An Introduction]]\n\n(note there are more in that library)\n\n(others to be added soon).\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/Safety Protocols/No Lock-ins/","title":"No Lock-Ins"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"There area variety of unwanted behaviours, that are often commercially motivated, that engender some form of lock-in that is contrary to the interests of [[The Values Project]] and in-turn also, [[The Webizen Charter]], [[Webizen Alliance]] and other related considerations.\n\nIn-order to support a means to maintain the hygiene of these environments and the underlying moral integrity of the broader objective, [[Data Portability]]  is being designed as one of the [[Safety Protocols]]. \n\nOthers include;\n\n## Golden Handcuffs\nI've been using the term 'golden handcuffs' for sometime, and only recently reviewed the definition provided for the Concept [Golden Handcuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs), finding that the meaning was in many ways different to what it was i was trying to describe.

These sorts of problems are in-fact very serious and need to be addressed as a matter of priority; particularly, in relation to behaviours that have serious negative implications and/or impacts upon children, and particularly therein - those that relate to the behaviours of adults that target children.\n\n\n*ChatGPT:*\n\nIn order for a person to be found guilty of committing a crime, the prosecution must be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person committed the crime as defined by law. This typically requires the prosecution to present evidence that demonstrates the elements of the crime, such as the act or conduct that constituted the crime, the intent or state of mind of the accused, and any attendant circumstances.\n\nIn criminal cases, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. This means that the prosecution must present evidence that is sufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence and to persuade the jury or judge that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIf the prosecution is able to meet this burden of proof, the accused may be found guilty of the crime. If the prosecution is unable to meet this burden of proof, the accused may be found not guilty or the case may be dismissed.\n\nOverall, the legal standard for finding someone guilty of a crime is high, and it is designed to ensure that individuals are not wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit.\n\nThere are several procedural requirements that must be followed in order to address an issue of criminal wrongdoing online, particularly if the account being used is not easily associated with the legal person using it. Some of the key steps that may be involved in this process include:\n\n1.  Investigation: The first step in addressing an issue of criminal wrongdoing online is typically to conduct an investigation. This may involve collecting and analyzing evidence, such as electronic records and documents, to determine the nature and extent of the wrongdoing.\n    \n2.  Identification of suspects: If the investigation reveals that a crime has been committed, the next step is typically to identify the suspects involved. This may involve using forensic techniques to trace the IP address of the account being used or to identify any other identifying information that may be associated with the account.\n    \n3.  Arrest and charging: If the suspects are identified and there is sufficient evidence to support charges, the next step is typically to arrest the suspects and charge them with the appropriate crimes.\n    \n4.  Pre-trial proceedings: Once the suspects have been charged, the case will typically proceed to pre-trial proceedings, which may include plea negotiations, motions, and other legal proceedings.\n    \n5.  Trial: If the case is not resolved through pre-trial proceedings, it will typically proceed to trial, where the prosecution will present its case and the defense will present its case.\n    \n6.  Verdict and sentencing: If the suspects are found guilty, the court will typically impose a sentence, which may include imprisonment, fines, or other penalties.\n    \n\nOverall, the process of addressing an issue of criminal wrongdoing online can be complex and time-consuming, and it requires the involvement of law enforcement agencies and legal professionals.

This conceptual framework seeks to provide support for the values frameworks the webizen environments are built to support.  In-effect, providing some of the foundational considerations or 'tenants' to a form of moral framework, that helps to inform design requirements.\n\n### Human Centric\n\nThe development of any tools, whether it be companies or things; is intended to support the needs of humanity and/or members of our human family, and through us, our Social Spheres([SocioSphere Ontologies](SocioSphere%20Ontologies.md)) and the use of resources, our role in our Biosphere ([Biosphere Ontologies](Biosphere%20Ontologies.md)).  No other form of agent can be sent to prison.  The responsibility for what occurs in our world is fundamentally held by Human Beings.  \n\nWhilst there are always complexities involved in almost any circumstance and indeed also the evaluation of that circumstance by others; the fundamental role of technology is to provide useful tools for human beings, to improve and manage their relationships with other agents; both as an active natural agent, and as an observer.  \n\n### Agent Centric\n\nThe term Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'.\n\nIt is noted that in some juristictions the term 'person' may refer to a natural person (human being) or a 'legal personality' (Incorporated Entity (such as a company) / legal person). \n\nIn legal terms, an agent is defined to mean;\n*One who agrees and is authorized to act on behalf of another, a principal, to legally bind an individual in particular business transactions with third parties pursuant to an agency relationship.*\n\nSource: https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/agent\n\nAs such, the term 'agent' is intended to provide a distinction between the entity, person or 'actor' (ie: software / \"Ai Agent\") that is performing some sort of task or activity; and the role in which that agent is undertaking that task.  \n\nWhilst there are many senarios where the concept of Agent Centric semantics apply, one example is;\n\n*a natural person in their own private capacity may hold some particular belief or moral position about something, circumstance, etc.  If they are acting on behalf of an employer or other entity; they may be required to carry out tasks in a particular way that may not be of their own choosing.*  \n\n### Entity Centric\n\nEntity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.).  \n\nThis is interactive with both agent and human centric semantics; whilst seeking to support a structural framework around defining how systems are developed to support a means to associate the activities, rights and responsibilities of an entity as does exist in our offline socio-economic world, to be supported in being able to maintain the same principles based structure online, in webizen environments. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/Economic Systems/Currencies/","title":"Currencies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Stack intends to produce support for an array of different 'currencies', whereby the term itself isn't simply or solely about money, but also various other factors relating to a broader semantic concept of socio-economic and biosphere interactions, in particular (there are others).\n\nSupport for Micropayments is incredibly important, yet the modelling for how micropayments are achieved also needs to take into consideration the cost of energy and other supply / distribution chain related costing frameworks. \n\nSimilar yet differently, are various forms of 'social currencies', which on the present-day web are fairly simple; such as how many views or likes or 'friends' an 'account' has; yet, it may be a bot that has been set-up for socially narfarious purposes.\n\nIn other parts of our social fabric; there's issues where it is not easy for people to declare and communicate that they've been going down some difficult path of trying to talk about an important topic with integrity; and that they've been harmed for doing so during a time where others didn't understand, and when others start to learn about the realities of whatever it is they were talking about earlier (getting harmed); then, there's no benefit - others take over, whilst their 'social reputation' is still damaged for having spoken about it earlier when the statements were unpopular.  Conversely also; people who make popular statements, that are later found false.\n\nSome of these considerations are explored further in the document about [Social Attack Vectors](Social%20Attack%20Vectors.md) alongside the objective outline about [Ending Digital Slavery](Ending%20Digital%20Slavery.md).\n\nAnother area of interest is about 'learning' or 'knowledge' currencies', whereby the activities that people are able to be shown to have both done and understood; creates some sort of acknowledgement benefit, that may help them better qualify themselves for particular kinds of activities (ie: work).\n\nThere are many different types of 'currencies' and part of the webizen project / process, is to explore how they may be made to work - for the betterment of human kind. \n\n### Considerations about AI & Human Dignity (inc. privacy)\n\nWhilst many are fearful of a 'social credit score' or similar; the reality is that these systems already exist, its just that they're operating in a way that's very poor / morally improveraged. \n\nWhether or not 'consumers' are aware of the vast amount of information about people that is collected by alternative systems, website and web-related services; the difference between exposing and modelling how these sorts of things could (or 'should') work, is actually far better than setting it aside - which doesn't mean others aren't aware of these metrics, rather, that the 'data subject' (the target) is unaware of it.

Yet, there is a long-history of related works and links that i'll add to the Work Project folder at some stage (when i get to it)...\n\nThe Work project is perhaps one of the most essential elements to the broader [[Peace Infrastructure Project]], including but not limited to; the enabling works described as being constituencies of [[Web Civics]] alongside that of [[Webizen]], are intended to produce an environment that supports the means to provide economic models that better support the needs of those who are primarily engaged in fields of [[Knowledge Work]] in particular; yet, the methodologies have an array of other applications more broadly.\n\nThese other usecases will seek to consider producing a means to provide tools for people whose lives would be benefited if they were more easily able to manage their ability to engage with a multitude of employers and those whose type of work involves multiple clients  providing payments for their services; alongside other use-cases more broadly.  however, the fundamental requirement of the work prject, is to support both; the works relating to the development of [[Web Civics]], which will continue to develop works that are more focused on [[Web Science]] activities; alongside, [[Webizen]] and the [[Webizen Alliance]] requirements as the priority, as the means to do anything else hinges upon the ability to produce a platform that is designed to be made able to support how any other forms of work are able to be done, using it.  As such; the critical technical requirements are part of the [[Webizen 3.0]] project, with significant improvements expected through the use of this platform, to produce the [[Webizen 3.5]] solutions; and related works that are hoped to emerge through the growth of participants doing useful works (or works that are hoped to become useful) on the initial platform tools.\n\n## Commercial Structures\n\nThe Work Project seeks firstly; to support a framework where all forms of [[Project Financing]] are treated equally.  that is, that if unpaid or funded work is undertaken by someone and the useful derivatives of that contribution are useful; then, they're treated in the same way as any other investor - subject to an array of particular terms, to better contextualise the nature of the circumstance, etc.  This seeks to engender rules that basically act to support 'good faith relations' in a manner that attends to the derivatives of [[The Values Project]] structurally.\n\nWhilst derivative implications end-up with a requirement for [[Biosphere Ontologies]] and [[SocioSphere Ontologies]] to provide support for [[Micropayments]] systems (in particular), the architecture is intended to be broadly ***'Project Orientated'***, as to support a means to couple the relationship between the useful thing that has been produced and the socioeconomics that relates to its lifecycle as a #thing.\n\nThereafter, there is an array of [[Contribution Classifications]] that are importantly defined which then have implications on the [[Work Valuation Methods]] and in-turn also, the licensing frameworks.  \n\nThere are an array of [[Social Attack Vectors]] that will directly target these constituencies of the ecosystem.  It is important that there are both clear rules and systems in place to address disputes.  \n\nThe [[Licensing Frameworks]] will be particularly attentive to circumstances in which works relate to the fundemental rights of Human Beings (ie: Core [[Values Credentials]] ); and will distinguish between natural persons (human beings), organisations with reduced means vs. users who are enterprise, large corporations, Government and other similar sorts of entities whose nature is different and that there is a capacity to form licensing frameworks for those types of users in a manner that distinguishes their obligations differently to those of others. \n\nThis type of mechanism is intended to provide the means to support [[Knowledge Work]] compensation for the development and creation of tooling that is required to support the foundational requirements of tooling relating to the [[Peace Infrastructure Project]] in a manner that seeks compensatory revenues (income) from organisations; whom, for example, may be defined as having a cash flow of above $3m AUD Per Annum or by way of structural identity frameworks (ie: in circumstances where analysis is not feasible); as may be determined by a [[Webizen Alliance]] provider; whilst, \n\nProviding the derivative tooling free of charge to all other users.  \n\nIn other circumstances; where the work-derivative is some sort of 'optional' #thing then the cost may be collected from all users at some rate defined by the projects leaders; but that, the overall compensatory amount is sought to be built upon a fixed return for the total effort calc (ie: [[Project Financing]] ); for whatever that body of work is defined as being.  In some cases, work will continue to provide new versions and/or additional maintainence and support for whatever that thing is; which in-turn, ends-up being attributed to the economic frameworks associated with that thing.\n\nWhilst conceptually supported; yet not at all the focus at present, if someone invents something that is entirely optional, as in - its a market based product that might be distinct, yet, a persons life (ie: [[Values Credentials]] ) are not going to be disaffected by not having it; then, whoever sells it is entirely entitled to seek to charge whatever they want; and if people want to pay for it, that's really upto them.  as they say 'its a free market'; yet, these sorts of considerations do not apply to works that are critical for [[Peace Infrastructure Project]] related purposes.  \n\n**Donations**: if people want to make donations or gift to persons above and beyond the project related economic protocols; that's also find, but also not sought to be required.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/Host Service Requirements/Authentication Fabric/","title":"Authentication Fabric"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"(incomplete - to be updated)\nThe Authentication Fabric is complicated and involves many parts, that are intended to work as an ecosystem.  \n\nThe effect of the Authentication Fabric is intended to result in a curatable, highly secure & accountability 'fabric' with attribute based access control; that becomes managable via the query interface (alongside more manual interfaces). \n\nThere's a couple of different layers involved in this Authentication Fabric.\n\n### Authentication of Devices\nA variety of host-fingerprinting information is employed and thereafter supported via [WebID Specifications](WebID%20Specifications.md) [WebID-TLS](Semantic%20Web/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS.md), [WebID-TLS](Semantic%20Web/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS.md) and similar.  \n\nNB: https://github.com/jaypipes/ghw\n \n### Network Authentication tooling\nThe \"Network\" Authentication fabric makes use of IPv4/IPv6 (preferred) tooling, alongside DNS, TLS, [Verifiable Claims & Credentials](Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md) and [WebID-OIDC](Semantic%20Web/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-OIDC.md)\n\n### Agent Authentication Tooling\nAgent based authentication links with the semantic authentication chain, alongside [WebID-OIDC](Semantic%20Web/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-OIDC.md) and [Verifiable Claims & Credentials](Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md) alongside tools such as [WebAuthn](Webizen%20Tech%20Stack/Webizen%203.0/Webizen%20App%20Spec/WebSpec/WebPlatformTools/WebAuthn.md). \n\nNOTE\nThis document is incomplete.

The works done by me, with others, in these areas dates back to the 1995-6 or so; although those were very early days, and a great deal more was achieved from 2000 onwards.  Some of the old diagrams continue to present models, that remain similar; whilst some of the problems that were experienced even back then, still remain & in some ways have become far worse or minimally described - different, overtime.  \n    \n2.  By 2010 works had started on employing HTTP ‘Semantic Web’ tooling; which in-turn led to a significant involvement in the creation of new ‘web standards communities’ which led to new standards, of vast significance to humanity at large; given how they’ve been implemented.  Standards work is a different job, to producing software / applications that make use of the tools produced & made available (royalty free ‘patent pool protected’ standards, etc); to produce particular products, and as time goes on requirements shift.\n    \n3.  A Major constituency of the purposeful efforts has been to support human rights related ‘technological infrastructure’ apparatus.  A design focus, has been to consider the needs of the poor, the vulnerable and those in need of accessible & appropriate support for lawful considerations & available legal recourse / remedy (ie: natural justice); which is now demonstrably shown to have been an unusual focus, given what has been supported; and what continues to be in an area of distressing problems, that have not been resolved. \n    \n4. Whilst the modelling has direct applications for incorporate entity infrastructure (ie: corporate, government, education; in all the many areas); individuals in their private capacities needs to be provided ‘digital agency’ in-order to support anything else well; these considerations are discussed via the lens of ‘values’ and in particular ‘human rights’,\n\n5. Service to support ‘human rights’ are presently expensive (at least $120 AUD / PA, per entity group (ie: individual or family);  including but not limited to,\n\ta.  The Rental Costs for a Domain Name\n    b. The Service Costs for an online (“cloud”) server (hosting / vps, etc.) that provides support for ‘fixed IPs’ (HTTPS support)\n    \n6. The ability to support ‘home “read/write” applications that employ HTTP services (which is often not supported by residential internet connections); which in-turn means, that some sort of VPN like functionality is required.  \n      \n    NOTE: online services are subject to ‘choice of law’ terms, which are often not in the same jurisdiction as the intended beneficiary of that apparatus (indeed, they’re often not even in the same country).  \n\n7.  Technically; ‘Semantic Web’ uses HTTP URis. Whilst other non-http based protocols can be employed, there is still a requirement to ensure support for HTTP(s) & DNS (ie; domain name, email, etc) services.  There is also a lack of support for IPv6 in many areas, alongside other legacy issues linked to ICANN (the domain name business); Now therefore, there are complex issues that are emerging as a consequence of ‘web3’ (DLTs) solutions that are not the same as the Web (world-wide-web / www); or other protocols that operate on internet.  \n      \n    At a social level; the problem becomes the misuse of the concept of ‘identity’ in how it is applied to the use of tooling and the impact that has upon societies.  \n      \n    At a commercial level; the use of the term ‘identity’ is linked with commercial benefits should any one ‘thing’ (company, blockchain, etc.) control human entities, that is often very difficult to ‘stop using’ - a simple example, would be the dependencies upon public free email addresses provided by large organisations such as Microsoft (hotmail), Google (gmail) and Apple (iCloud) - although; even simply with respect to that one ‘identifier’, the semantic ‘stickiness’ also has implications with respect to accounts provided by internet providers, universities and employers.  Whilst there are MANY examples, the simple one of an ‘email address’, does in-turn have an array of dependency implications across many areas.  \n      \n    ‘Semantic Web’ refers to an ecosystem of parts principally developed via the W3C; which create the foundational requirements for artificial intelligence services through various tools that define how information is both structured and then able to be employed by systems that have been produced to use ‘semantic web’ tooling.  In-effect, its like Internet Protocol; for electronic (structured) information and information processing related services, which then in-turn powers ‘AI’. The designs required; need to bring the human agent, equitably (and responsibly) into the equations, which is able to be brought about using an ecosystem of tools; that in-turn have dependencies upon the use of HTTP ‘server related’ services. \n\n\n## Deliberations: Some recent architectural work and linked considerations.\n\nIn a 2017 presentation / talk on [“The End of Cloud Computing”](https://a16z.com/2019/11/15/the-end-of-cloud-computing-2/) General Partner of Andreessen Horowitz Peter Levine explains how cloud technology is changing for an edge cloud model.  \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4QTAtFaIiyc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nPut simply, Lavine presents the case illustrating how the mass of (IoT) devices ‘at the edge’ requires ‘edge processing’; or in other words, that the computational requirements for devices within ‘personal area networks’ cannot be supported by (international) ‘cloud computing’ capabilities alone.  Reviewing this presentation again recently, reminded me of the physics (in-effect) involved in effectively delivering modern capabilities - even if the moral considerations are not enough.  This ‘battle’ between ‘mainframe’ like systems, and personal computing - is a very old trend.  \n\nI have made a somewhat brief ‘Timeline Exhibit’ of various clips relating in particular to Steve Jobs & Tim Berners-Lee which can be found via the link below.\n\nThe creation, production & commercialisation of (cyber) infrastructure - cannot be done quickly enough; yet clearly, the historical / ‘legacy’ business models bound to WWW focused internet services - where global silos are the primary operators / definers of our means for advancement; is indeed problematic, and in-turn also - there are various barriers to creating solutions that can support inter-juristictionality, centred upon the needs of natural persons; as to thereby, uplift any other capacities human beings have in our societies, socio-economically, creatively & otherwise.\n\nThese major silos - are in-effect, highly centralised globally as are many ‘DLTs’ (ie: blockchains) although the characteristics are different.  As such, whilst there is a great deal of concern about ‘splinter-net’ or a world of many separate internets - this is in-effect, a difficult puzzle.  From a user-perspective, there’s already ‘separate internets’; such as Microsoft, Apple, Google & facebook; with others in other regions (ie: Asia, etc).   So with that being said…\n\nI find myself looking into VPN technologies as a means to support - in-effect - human agency.  One of the examples I have found is a SDN Networking technology called WireGuard which is then provided a services layer to support private networks via technologies such as TailScale, which is in-turn being supported by other open-source projects such as headscale.  What it does is create a privately addressable network that supports HTTP, TLS, DNS (ETC) enabling private networking of ‘read/write’ (distributed - semantic web based - services); alongside ‘exit nodes’ that provide an ability for a nominated service / server - to provide public-internet connectivity with the rest of the network; that is in-turn connected both, to ‘regular internet’ as well as the ‘private network’ that is set-up using these technologies.  More information about how this particular solution works can be found [https://tailscale.com/](https://tailscale.com/) (inc. blog, etc.). \n\nPart of what’s also occurring (note headscale, as noted above); is that there’s user-authentication using OIDC; and in-turn also, TLS certificates being issued to devices.  Whilst neither of these solutions appear to support ‘Web-ID’ ecosystem components (ie: SubjectAltName: FOAF (or RDF) URI); it does not appear to be a massive problem to add it; and in-turn, the opportunity becomes, packaging these tools (libraries / services) with either an updated ‘RWW (read-write-web)’ solution or indeed also, the more modern (yet different) solid related variants - or some future harmonisation of both; as a consequence of building and deploying solutions, that ‘make sense’. \n\n## CONSIDERATIONS: Leading to a Hypothesis\n\nRWW servers were originally designed to employ RDF, LDP WebID-TLS as an authentication instrument; and through that, the server was then able to be extended via various service layers (SPARQL, LDN, etc.).  There are old (webizen related) libraries that exist, but they’ve not been updated.  One example in particular, GOLD (Go Linked Data (or RWW) server) is written in GoLang (“Go”), as are the software libraries for Headscale / Tailscale.  \n\nSo, what if there was an integration done to produce ‘client apps’ (nodes) that support both the Private Networking topology with a bundled ‘RWW server’; alongside, a ‘server based’ version (“exit Node” / public gateway / designed for data-center related deployments); that may in-turn also provide support for provisioning & managing a customers domain name; whilst also providing an WebID-OIDC based IdP, that is in-turn used to deploy the WebID-TLS certs on client devices, that via WebID-TLS provides transparent authentication, via the TLS certificate WebID. \n\nThis approach, appears to end-up being closer to the original ‘rww’ works; than the newer’ works (to-date); noting, that the older RWW ‘apps’ (simple HTML5) were very simple to create by comparison to the newer ones(generally NodeJS / server based apps); that are in-fact far more complicated, as are the ‘access control’ issues.  Whilst the ‘decentralisation’ objective is good; the threat becomes, aggregating all of a person's life into a singular container that ends-up being exploited by bad actors; perhaps without any means to know about what might have occurred and/or been deleted or modified.  \n\n## ‘Home as a platform’ vs. ‘gov as a platform’.\n\nHome is where the heart is, but what will AI say, about how government money influences what occurs should people find themselves in a situation where they’ve got some very serious problems at home; what is it, do you think, AI will be able to demonstrate - what they’re priorities have actually been, as demonstrated by the outcomes.  Is the fear of #RealityCheckTech - undermining our capacity for peace?\n\nMuch of these works over, particularly over the past 12 years or so; has been undertaken in very difficult circumstances, with the express intent to ensure natural persons (human beings in their private capacity) were provided the technological tools required, to support their relationship with law & therefore, peace.  However, this has not been supported by the government, who has consequently funded the costs of significant harms and consequential enquiries and related costs.  The program known as ‘robodebt’ is a good example of the nature of these decisions; whereby, if people had of been supported to be able to store their own electronic evidence / legal records of importance; then, providing machine-readable payslips would have been easily performed and/or compelled to have been performed via lawful means.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to reasonably support any claim that Government will of its own volition, provide the cyber-infrastructure requirements needed by citizens, to protect their rights unto law and in-turn, act to support both our system of government and our means to protect our society from the harmful consequences of those engaged in organised activities causing serious injury to others; by ensuring, circumstances of a nature that should reasonably lead to a complaint being made in a court of law, are provided the supports needed to demonstrate governmental commitments to the various instruments that exist; whether it be UN instruments, including but not limited to the UDHR, or the principles set-forth in the Charter of the Commonwealth or indeed the specific statements made by various state and federal laws / legislation, conventions and legal precedents.  Put simply, the importance of useful employment of law / rule of law and in-turn its very important role with respect to peace and human rights; has not been demonstrated to have been provided the respect or support, needed, to protect the most vulnerable in our society, which is not about any discriminatory factors alone; rather, that the complex consequences of not providing an opportunity for alternative ‘business systems’ to emerge inter-domestically, will not stop the consequences of what will otherwise occur as Artificial Intelligence grows in its capacities and influences, via globally centralised platforms; or via alternative ecosystems.\n\n## Webizen Networks - by WebCivics (& Trust Factory)\n\nWebizen is a project that seeks to produce a new class of computing environment that incorporates many complex concepts that are not well understood by the vast majority; particularly, the details. \n\nNonetheless - The broad-strokes of it, is that its a sort of ‘information management fabric’ that i’ve been working on for a very long time; and, now decades later, there’s a bunch of work done by various other people around the world, many luminaries involved, whose collective efforts; enable the creation of an ecosystem, that works to address various - very significant problems; social, economic, cyber, (inc. AI), etc.\n\nThe hypothesis (as I've put it); of employing some sort of networking solution like the one mentioned, appears to reduce the effective entry-level cost significantly.  I think, its important to stipulate & structure the organisational approach (reflected in-turn by the technology topology) to support ‘common jurisdictional presence’ for legal entities; which in-turn means, that ‘by default’, users would ‘sign-up’ to a webizen networking / Semantic (AI) SDN service that has contractual arrangements within their jurisdiction.\n\nThese systems also maintain some level of ‘controls’ via the end-node interfaces and the capabilities built there.  In a worst-case scenario where a bad-actor needs to be ‘shut-down’ that could be done at the IdP; equally, an array of other capabilities can be provided as a distributed processing capability, providing HTTP services whilst at a lower-cost than is otherwise able to occur, through the use of existing VPS solutions alone.  This business model, requires support via a particular form of commercial (for purpose) approach; but, is aimed at providing mechanisms / methodologies, to support a differentiation between the capabilities needed to defend our societies from the threats of crime internationally; vs. domestic / local approaches, and in-turn also (governance) responsibilities and other aspects relating to the ‘right to self determination’ (human rights / democracy / prevention/protection from foreign interference, etc.) & access to justice. \n\nSo, if this were done in a way; that is consistent with the various ‘human rights’ related considerations, which in-turn relate to licensing and other mechanisms to support dignity and address ‘digital slavery’ issues; whilst maintaining (indeed enhancing) support for the creation of software for the good of humanity; there are centralisation related implications, unlike ‘web 2.0’ or “#Web3”; and provide a capacity to produce electronic governance frameworks, to support cooperative, Collaborative and supportive socio-economic ecosystems, Inter-juristictionally / internationally; noting, these systems, do not prevent ‘old internet’ from continuing to function, it just provides a different environment for different kinds of apps / computing platforms / work & AiTech environments; that seeks, to mediate operational tasks, in a way that accelerates our capacity to improve productivity and radically extend our support for a regenerative and rejuvenative evolutionary paradigm shift, as a consequence of good designs for the use of ICT Tools. \n\n Yet, this is an R&D process; which is expected to evolve overtime and will be particularly vulnerable at the early stages of any ‘commercialisation’ (including software production); via well funded adversaries. \n\n## Design Considerations - as an initial ‘options analysis’ derivative.\n\nIF, this path is investigated and/or further developed; then considerations are as follows,\n\n### User Experience\n\n1.  User goes to webizen.au (for example) and sets-up an account.\n    \n2.  Once the account is setup (with or without their own domain, etc.) then they can download ‘client software’ which is basically a ‘vpn’ like thing that has a RWW ‘social-web /  webizen server’ baked into it; which then operates in a federated manner with other devices in their ‘private network’.\n    \n3.  User then creates or downloads apps that depend upon these services existing; whereby the app is simply ‘client side’ pulling the data from the network; and using local machine resources to perform various tasks. (there are various libraries for Go app development that support interfaces for media processing, cuda, tensor, etc.). \n    \n4.  The user then downloads the clients for other devices; and the ‘information environment’ works in a federated manner.  This provides an opportunity to assign ‘capabilities’ of different devices in the users network, and distribute tasks to different agents (servers) programmably.\n    \n\n### Notes about ‘solid’ vs. RWW vs. ‘Webizen’\n\nAs noted in related documentation, the term ‘webizen’ was used by the ‘original ‘RWW’ team; and whilst honouring their efforts is part of the moral goals of the project; there are also alot of changes being made.\n\n-   It's not seemingly a topology that is ‘the same’ as solid: there are other factors / elements of the broader ‘webizen’ design that are also different, so this isn’t necessarily a problem, noting, solid is also a ‘work in progress’ and their specifications may well change based upon what Tim Berners-lee (or other influencers involved) believe is the most appropriate approach, as does develop overtime.  \n      \n-   There is possibility of providing, what is in-effect, ‘transparent’ authentication at the ‘device’ or ‘user-account’ level; via the TLS certificate (WebID-TLS / WebID-RSA, etc) to personalise the session, which is in-turn authenticated against a user when they set-up the network ‘node’.  \n      \n-   An ability to support some sort of log-in/log-out (WebID-OIDC based) on shared computers is needed.  There are also considerations to make about others using someone else's device (ie: children, or someone else - who may not be behaving in a ‘friendly’ manner).\n    \n-   2nd factor AUTH could be supported via various devices in a network (ie: a smartphone) by assigning that device a role to perform that task.  This and many other ‘features’ / workflows; would ideally be relatively simple to create (ie: via web-assets rather than continual upgrades to the underlying compiled runtime) as often as possible.  \n      \n-   Another implication is that, due to the ‘data storage structure’, disconnection from the network doesn’t result in a user loosing their data; which is one of many positive qualities of this approach.  \n      \n-   The future ‘webizen’ platform - will require a great deal more work & capabilities to deliver the sorts of capabilities that is sought to be brought about; whether or not ‘go’ is right for the client in the long-term, is yet to be known.  There are ‘bindings’ for other languages; but overall, there’s a need to create a platform that can support the development of the broader ‘webizen’ project, including but not limited to the delivery of initial that are very much focused on providing a ‘solid’ or ‘rww’ like, environment, that can be easily employed by persons working from home or wherever they are; to collaboratively do work through ‘web apps’ that are cheaply employable.   \n      \n    Without forming some sort of decentralised foundation for how people are able to work with one another; the outcome of being able to decentralise and support the purpose of these works, has never before actually been delivered.  In-part, this is a commercial issue that’s hard to address once investment has gone into whatever the ‘proof of concept’ body of work is; and thereby, socialised to other persons whose focus is most often about how to make the most out of it all.  \n      \n-   A Loosely coupled approach; could also provide support for other groups to produce similar solutions using different protocols, or indeed also, the ability for future clients; to support an array of different protocols - a bit like plugins or extensions i guess…  This would in-turn require a specification defining what is required to support specific functionality in relation to use cases.\n    \n-   Note also; there are various ‘packages’ such as ‘nextcloud’ and its office-app functionality, alongside various other ‘web-apps’ that can be run relatively easily, on a high-powered laptop or desktop like device (basically - on consumer equipment); but the hosting costs / set-up processes, have historically been prohibitive.   \n      \n    Whilst further integration opportunities are very interesting, there’s also a meaningful opportunity to provide near-immediate support for users to get these sorts of platforms working at home, at nominal cost, for private groups; which is envisaged to significantly uplift innovation & productivity.  \n\n\n# GOALS\n\n1.  To investigate & identify if there’s any interest in this approach; and if there’s any significant flaws associated with going down this path; should we pass this precondition; then,\n    \n2.  Funding is desirable and the organisation should be set-up to support development & Go To Market (“GTM”) works in addition to the works required to develop an international ‘Community’.\n    \n3.  A Software Development project to integrate the networking stack with the ‘RWW / Solid’ (more RWW than solid, imo) tooling; to produce both installable clients for consumer devices; as well as a ‘host platform’, that is designed to support the functionality only able to be supported via data centre hosting.  Additional software development projects would include the ‘apps’ (social, modifications to existing RWW(/early solid) apps & the work project).\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/Host Service Requirements/Website Host/","title":"Website Host"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The \"Web Host\" [Server Functionality Summary (VPS|[VPS)](../Implementation%20V1/vps/Server%20Functionality%20Summary%20(VPS)]].md) is intended to provide information about the VPS (virtual Private Server) side functionality required to support local 'webizen' servers.\n\nThe Webizen Environment will provide a means to support public permissions.

As the existing documentation method consumes markdown (.md) files, and it is difficult to provide support for the extended functionality via the .md file itself; perhaps the way it could be done is to provide some sort of ```.meta ``` file (not necessarily that extension) that has the same file-name and internally references the file; via a link provided in the ```.md``` file, as to provide a means for a parser to be provided the functionality to represent the information via a render. \n\nNOTE: The  Gatsby library uses react, which supports #GraphQL but not natively #RDF.  Whilst i am unsure if the version control method using Git could be supported for presentation; the information could be provided as a link to the commit information.   \n\n### Gatsby \nThe Gatsby Presentation library would need to be updated to process the metadata files. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/HyperMediaContainers/Webizen 3.0 apps/","title":"Webizen 3.0 Apps"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Webizen 3.0 is a 'hello world' platform.

It is generally understood to mean that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired result, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result.\n\nIn contrast, behavior that is intentionally harmful, exploitative, or a willful breach of an agreement of fair dealings would involve a conscious choice to act in a way that is detrimental to others or that goes against the terms of an agreement. This type of behavior would not be considered to be making a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as it would be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions rather than a desire to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nTo expand on my interpretation, \"best efforts\" refers to an obligation or promise to use a reasonable level of care and diligence in achieving a particular result. This means that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired outcome, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result. This means that if something goes wrong or the desired result is not achieved, it is not necessarily a breach of the obligation as long as the person has made a good faith effort to achieve the result.\n\nIn contrast, mistakes that are made intentionally are different because they involve a conscious choice to act in a certain way, rather than being an unintentional or unforeseen outcome. Intentional mistakes are typically made with the knowledge that they are likely to result in a negative outcome, and may be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions. These mistakes would not be considered to be made in good faith or as a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as the person making the mistake is acting in a way that is not in line with the goal or purpose of the activity.\n\nSource: Chat.OpenAi.com"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/Social Ontology/Fit For Purpose/","title":"Fit For Purpose"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"*Content produced quickly via ChatGPT*\n\n>*When designing tools that form part of an ecosystems solution that is implemented using software and socio-economic systems; how would you define a rule or condition that a useful component should be 'fit for purpose', define 'fit for purpose'..*\n\nThe term \"fit for purpose\" refers to the extent to which a product, service, or system is suitable or appropriate for the specific purpose or use for which it was designed. When designing tools as part of an ecosystem solution that is implemented using software and socio-economic systems, it is important to ensure that each component is \"fit for purpose\" in order to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of the overall solution.\n\nTo ensure that a component is \"fit for purpose,\" it is necessary to consider a number of different factors. These might include the specific requirements or needs of the users or stakeholders who will be interacting with the component, the technical capabilities and limitations of the component, and any regulatory or compliance requirements that must be met.\n\nOverall, a component is considered \"fit for purpose\" if it meets the specific needs and requirements of the users or stakeholders, and if it performs the functions it was designed to perform in an effective and efficient manner.\n\n\n> *What sorts of considerations should be made to evaluate whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular usecase?*\n\nThere are several considerations that should be made when evaluating whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular use case.

The cost and value of the solution: It is also important to consider the cost of the solution and to ensure that it provides good value for money.

Learning can take place in a variety of contexts, including in formal educational settings, such as schools or universities, or informally, through life experiences or self-directed study.\n\nThere are many different approaches to learning, and people learn in different ways. Some people may learn more effectively through hands-on experience, while others may learn better through reading or listening to lectures.\n\nLearning can be a continuous process that occurs throughout a person's life, as they encounter new situations and experiences that challenge them to learn and adapt. It can also be a deliberate process, as people may seek out learning opportunities in order to acquire new knowledge or skills.\n\nOverall, learning is a fundamental aspect of human development and is essential for personal and professional growth and success.\n\n### The Use of Open Badges with Webizen\n\n[[Open Badges]]  can be used to provide recognition of prior learning for knowledge workers via systems that support Webizen AI agents in a number of ways:\n\n1.  Recognition of skills and expertise: AI agents can be used to assess the skills and expertise of knowledge workers and issue Open Badges to recognize their learning and achievements. This can help to provide evidence of skills and abilities that may be difficult to demonstrate through traditional methods.\n    \n2.  Verification of learning: Open Badges can be used to verify the learning and achievements of knowledge workers, helping to ensure that their skills and expertise are accurately represented.\n    \n3.  Portability of learning: Open Badges can be easily shared and displayed on a variety of online platforms, making it easier for knowledge workers to share their learning and achievements with others. This can be particularly useful for knowledge workers who may work in a variety of different settings or who may be seeking to demonstrate their skills to potential employers or clients.\n    \n\nOverall, Open Badges can be a useful tool for providing recognition of prior learning for knowledge workers via systems that support AI agents, helping to provide evidence of skills and expertise and making it easier to share learning and achievements with others.\n\n\n### Objective\n\nThe objective is to improve the way people are able to be supported by recgonition of prior learning applications of [[Cognative AI]] tooling.  These systems will seek to develop an evidence base to support a conclusion that a person can be asserted to have knowledge of concepts, things, fields of expertise and other factors of importance in relation to the performance of new work activities, as is in-turn made possible by the prior performance of activities. \n\nIn-part, what this constituency seeks to form a means to address, relates to innovation in particular; but also, an array of other socio-economic and governance factors.  \n\nWithin the field of innovation, people work on new ideas that form new 'things', of various types.  Yet traditional / historical means of qualification have been mostly focused upon the use of academic facilities; who do not offer qualifications about the knowledge of a field that is presently being invented.  The consequence is that the people who were instrumental to the creation of a new field of expertise, are subsequently not considered to be qualified in the area and consequentially; both, discriminated against due to not having done a course relating to the field (only available later); and in-turn somewhat forced to pay 'rents' to obtain qualifications for an area that they may have been involved in creating / inventing!.\n\nThe commonly accepted solution for this problem, is to simply pay the 'rents' or suffer the consequences.\n\nThe other area illustrated, about improving [[ESG]] support (in-effect); is that projects that are run by groups may in-turn nominate a person to take-on a role that they are not competently equipped to perform; and as a consequence of these sorts of practices, harms may in-turn be incurred by others - that may well be of a kind, that has no appropriate available lawful remedy.  \n\nIn a similar yet different area; a person may be charged with the responsibility of providing an analysis of a situation and acting or failing to act in a circumstance that has material consequences upon others; but they've not got the skills to comprehend some sort of important facts, due to a lack of skills or knowledge in that area.  Consequentially the person may act negligently and/or engage in - what is in-effect - an act of violence, and then seek protection at a later time, irraspective of the consequences put upon others.  At which stage, the situation may in-turn become adverserial and the victim is unlikely to be resourced with lawful remedy, compensation and/or even simply an otherwise appropriate apology and whatever further actions may need to take place in-order to resolve the consequences of that persons mistakes; as was in-turn put, upon others.  These sorts of situations undermine 'good faith' relations and in-turn often invoke further wrong-doings as the mistakes of one person, may in-turn lead to an array of other persons seeking to cover up and/or protect the wrong-doer, irraspective of whether it was an honest mistake or a willful act of violence causing injury.\n\nSo the learning modals, seek to support sense-making to more rapidly produce contextually useful insights and related links that support a means to process the circumstances of a persons learning and seek to mitigate risks of events that may lead to disputes and/or [[Social Attack Vectors]] that may negatively impact a legal entities [[ESG]] and/or insurability status.\n\nAdditionally, the objective is to produce systems that can provide categorised qualification  [[Ontologies]] and [[Temporal Semantics]] that is in-turn intended to support [[Cognative AI]] processes (noting the importance of: [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]] ) and thereby providing support for [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] in relation to this field of [[Web Science]] and its means to address various [[Social Factors]].\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/personal-augmentation-of-ai/","title":"Personal Augmentation of AI"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 636\ntitle: 'Personal Augmentation of AI'\ndate: '2018-10-04T18:59:14+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=636'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is a complex set of interrelated concepts that in-turn bring about the means to programmatically define how software agents are made to work.

The decisions people make in applications today, can be translated to modal considerations made by those persons at the time; in a manner that can both retain the resolution of decisions made earlier, in addition to providing the means through which personally define changes can occur that in-turn changes the way a persons AI agent behaves.\n\nThis in-turn also supports the means to alter the resolution of queries, for example, to decide whether a person can identify the exact location of a person, or the approximate location of a person.

These legal instruments are most-often owned by the issuer of the credential; who provides it to the holder of the credential whilst maintaining the ability to cancel it and/or protect the instrument from misuse. \n\nIn this way, the definition of personhood is instrumentally provided authoritative notations that form relations between self and external groups whose participatory governance role, provides assurance, and the means to maintain a form of insurance, as is sought by others, in relation to their fiduciary responsibilities pertaining to self and any role of [agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency) they may be facilitating at a time of trade.\n\nInternet has brought about circumstances where former means, have been outmoded. ICT systems have been adapted to make use of our international systems of knowledge economy; whilst still failing to render meaningfully responsive service, to an array of unmet challenges.\n\nSome of these challenges include the means in which the notation of human reputation, contribution and socioeconomic participation is made; in systems of international ‘high-frequency’ trade. Where new instruments that render meaningful service to a ‘beneficial owner’, become moreover attributable to ‘surveillance’ and ‘attention’ related information exchanges by way of their agents, with few otherwise technically available options, having been explored or made easily available.\n\nToday, many social network service (SNS) platform providers have a persistent electronic relationship with users worldwide; whilst there continues to be a built-upon *fallacy,* that the exchange of providing access to the predetermined and asymmetrically defined, universal environment; without financial charge (other than purchase of equipment and the on-going payment for subscribing to make use of the environment) is the only alternative in an environment that is now inextricably depended upon, for socioeconomic participation. Whilst these systems make use of data to benefit their commercial purpose, it remains the case that a significant variety of alternative use-cases are left without support.\n\nComplicating matters further; As the means in which the information orchestration corpus is now operated; necessarily providing any and all knowledge to be transmitted, stored and made use of by them; artificial agents, owned and operated by them, designed to serve their needs, influence how it all works.\n\nThis situation is in-turn built upon, the implicit (rather than explicit) promissory ‘message’ that their environment – is indeed ‘fit for purpose’ for the beneficial use of personhood as to seek means in which to be made independently free, from all encumbrances be otherwise entitled to be attributed. In so doing, as we battle with issues such as fake news and ‘autocorrect’ issues (but not exclusive to it), our online systems furnish us with the right to define by way of express instruction; the means in which, ‘for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries’.\n\nTechnologically, it is the case, that the capabilities of the systems used and depended upon; are more capable of rendering a definition of what any such ‘discovery’ may be considered to have been beneficially ‘invented’ prior to any such human actor being made capable to undertake the necessary process as to complete their writings in independence for the purpose of seeking claim for any-such right.\n\nMaking matters more complicated; is the implication of legal means in which these ‘services’ are made useful by context to systems of law and diplomacy and inferred, lesser expressly considerations as they pertain to geopolitical stability and means in which to foster the works first documented by the means of international works undertaken in relation to the united nations, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”).\n\nThrough the use of credentials the means in which to associate group attributions as to make useful personhood; is now therefore performed. The issues of whether and/or how, ‘autocorrect’ or other artificial intelligence related services influenced communications and available ‘knowledge’, is being inextricably shaped by the operating characteristics of these systems. As it is the case, that autocorrect issues; and the practical process of fixing them, assists the operator to improve their artificial intelligence service; and that moreover, the principle driver of revenue is advertising as obtained through views and clicks, our world is being shaped through these narrow lens, world-wide; and the issue of ‘credentials’ or ‘verifiable claims’ has never, consequentially, been more important..\n\n##### Verifiable claims and Economics\n\nIn our knowledge based economy the means in qualification or endorsement as to serve the interests of group/s, of various forms; makes use of “official” documents, keys or insignia in which participants in groups, furnish individuals with ‘instruments’, designed to denote a skill, competency, privileged and/or membership, as required for privileged participatory rights in some way shape or form. Similarly ‘proofs’ be by so means provided a means to warrant that a particular creative work is considered to not have formerly been embodied. [Credentials](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/) form a means in which to present a claim, that is considered to be verified by a relevant authority who shares custodianship over the use of that claim. \n\nYet when considering the nuanced characteristics in which ‘electronic commons’ for the social benefits, as formerly facilitated in many ways, such as libraries, language and the irrelevance of extending these concept to a new electronic domain, the means to author, review, maintain, archive and make accessible; both old and new forms of commons, is needed to ensure access to articles of the natural world is both free and a shared responsibility. \n\nIn the production of these tools, services and bodies of work, that furnishes the means in which humanity is made able to learn; the practice of transferring notations into our infosphere is now also used for the contextual purpose of making available persistent accessibility to agents. \n\nThe context of which ‘electronic commons’ extends the ‘knowledge’ of microscopic and macroscopic natural world as a series of electronic embodiments of objects to universally make use of; As such, civics custodianship frameworks are required to address considerations as to the manner in which the underlying artefact of our natural world, be maintained and made accessible to all. \n\nThrough the use of ledger technology, that makes use of linked-data, the means to notate an array of disparate data-sources within a singular document provides a method to inter-lay information sources; that may include but not be limited to, sources made available by commercial means. \n\nLedger technology is also assistive, in decentralising the governance and discovery of electronic documents and the knowledge embodied by them.\n\nIn so-doing, a requirement that is brought about, where any commercial actor to both assist in the free propagation of natural world knowledge accessibility, can be responded to; as to simply notate the natural world, rather than seeking necessarily to take sole and/or proprietary custodianship of its accessibility / discoverability in the broader environment.\n\nThrough the use of various forms of decentralised ledger technology, the manner in which the discovery and informatics storage methods be considered to be rendered support for these elements pertaining to the humanitarian and artificial realms; is by way of ledger technology, whilst preferentially considerate of linked-data based decentralised ledger technologies such as IPFS, IPLD, Web Torrent alongside others. \n\nAccessibility to these ledgers is made possible, in-effect, by way of credentials. The credentials interact with the knowledge-source as to permissively assert relations in connection to the supply of information that pertains to the specified form of knowledge that source is maintaining. Inforgs are also expected to support the means in which to supply high-quality statistical information alongside an array of other new forms of data that can be supplied in a ‘privacy preserving’ manner through the use of federated services."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/what-are-credentials/dids-and-multisig/","title":"DIDs and MultiSig"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 619\ntitle: 'DIDs and MultiSig'\ndate: '2018-10-04T11:36:31+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=619'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nAs previously considered; there are an array of [integrally important ‘commons’](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/the-need-for-decentralised-open-linked-data/) and group activity works and resources that have an array of stakeholder tenancy environments that are in-turn bound to the [dignity vs. privacy](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/privacy-vs-dignity/) related issues.\n\nIt is technically sought, that the operation of a persons online systems may be carried out permissively and privately (save rule of law related needs). This is an important ICT construct requirement to support human dignity; alongside others, such as the importance of ensuring means for socio-economic participation, the ability to ensure systems are built upon a framework where humanity is the beneficiary of works made by us; alongside other considerations made by documents such as the [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/).\n\nThe means to provide an alternative framework to technically respond to these issues is entirely shaped by whether or not a ‘[knowledge banking industry](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-modernisation-of-socioeconomics/)‘ is made able to emerge. If information systems do not provide a means for persons to store and operate their own information systems environment in a manner rendered meaningful support by law; any solution built around alternative methods (based upon existing knowledge equity frameworks) become foundational in what solutions can be offered; and what is not able to be provided, due to these socioeconomically applied constraints.\n\nThe most meaningful constituent paradigm relating to the use of ledger technologies (or ‘blockchains’ as is most-often the commonly known, yet often misused term) and decentralised identifiers (that are not necessarily, [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) based.) becomes a circumstance of where it is the private keys are stored for access and meaningful use of these alternative technologies.\n\nLedger technologies all make use of cryptographic methods to make available, the means to ‘write’ to the ledger. This most often uses [Public Key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), which in-turn requires the private key, to be stored somewhere.\n\nThe relationship between the beneficial owner of an account that is publicly presented as a public key; is often solely based upon their means to privately retain exclusive use over the private key. Algorithms can generate them, as is exampled on the [all private key](http://www.allprivatekeys.com/) website for bitcoin (in an unsophisticated manner) and beyond that, the means to keep them means the locations their stored in; need to retain the means for the owner of them, to use them.\n\nThis is more difficult than it sounds, particularly for non-technical users.\n\nSo the first part of the puzzle; is about storing the private keys somewhere that is supported to be owned by beneficial owner of those software tools. It is considered that an institutional ‘knowledge banking system’ can help with this. The next issue, is the amount of power consumed by some of the block-chain methods; which i’ll cover in a different post.\n\nInstrumentally; what is ‘multi-sig’ or [multi-signatures](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature). Multi-Sig is the means to have multiple keys that provide the means to ‘unlock’ stuff. Through the use of Multi-Sig the means to ‘write’ to a ledger can be controlled by a group of keys and a subset of that group, who need to cooperatively use their key in-order to support write access. An example of how this done can be found [here.](https://coinb.in/multisig/)\n\nThe implications of this include; the means to assign a private key publicly to an object in the world, such as a coffee cup or parcel; via something like a [QR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) code or [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication) chip, and make use of it in relation to others (via semantics) whose private-keys are otherwise kept private. So, what and why are ledgers important and what does any of this have to do with DIDs?\n\nwell. The importance of [DIDs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) is the ability to build a bridge between traditional HTTP based URI services, and URI services (supporting linked-data) natively operated on protocols other than HTTP. This means in-turn, there is an ability to produce, preserve and support semantics using linked-data in relation to ‘groups’ and work-flows involving multiple participants. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly.\n\nAs reflected elsewhere; it is critical that the discovery of ‘commons assets’ is decentralised. A relatively easy way to think about this, is to consider the meaningful benefit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About) provides. Similarly, [archive.org](https://archive.org/) is another critical infrastructure constituent to the web; yet both of these organisations operate, in-turn, a form of centralised custodianship model; that does (in the case of wikimedia products in particular) support identification of agents in relation to edits; but is otherwise operated globally via a single group.\n\nThe means to decentralise how this works and how the underlying content is made discoverable (even in a semi-private environment) is brought about through the use of cryptography, ledger technologies, DIDs and related apparatus. Therein; whilst the rules, for how these technologies are applied to various considerations; the mainstay of how this can be brought about is in-turn made possible by making use of DIDs and Multi-Sig structures.\n\nHumans are different, they require inforgs; which in-turn, needs some sort of institutional framework designed to support them, which i call, a knowledge banking industry.\n\nThe reason why this relates to ‘credentials’, is that the contributions made to all forms of different fields, in a decentralised data-storage structure (that in-turn, supports provenance related structural support frameworks); is in-turn still permissively applied in relation to a persons ‘inforg’; and in-turn, the infrastructure requirements brought about (and able to be supported) by ‘knowledge banking providers’ that in-turn improve the reliability of ICT."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/Semantic Web/Ontologies/Human Rights Ontologies/UDHR/","title":"UDHR"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nAn Example of the UN [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) in RDF, is below.\n\nLinks to the Files are per below\n\nTurtle: https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/blob/2023/ttl/un/udhr.ttl\nJson-LD: https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/blob/2023/jsonld/un/udhr.jsonld\n\nThis is work in progress, there are many others that are on the to do list.\n\n```\n@prefix udhr: <http://www.udhr.org/ontology/udhr#> .\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n@prefix xhtml: <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/> .\n\n  \n\n<http://www.udhr.org/> a udhr:Declaration ;\n\n  udhr:hasPreamble [\n\n    a udhr:Preamble ;\n\n    udhr:hasText \"\"\"\n\n      Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,\n\n      Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,\n\n      Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,\n\n      Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations,\n\n      Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,\n\n      Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,\n\n      Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,\n\n      Now, Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.\n\n    \"\"\"@en ;\n\n  ] .\n\n  \n\n<http://www.udhr.org/> a udhr:Declaration ;\n\n  udhr:hasArticle [\n\n    a udhr:Article ;\n\n    udhr:articleNumber \"1\"^^xsd:integer ;\n\n    rdfs:label \"Article 1.

A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organization and Group.\n\nThe Agent class is useful in a few places in FOAF where Person would have been overly specific. For example, the IM chat ID properties such as jabberID are typically associated with people, but sometimes belong to software bots.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Agent `<http://purl.org/dc/terms/Agent>`\n\n## Person\n\n`foaf:Person`\n\n```\nfoaf:Person  rdf:type        rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Person\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A person.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Person class represents people. Something is a Person if it is a person. We don't nitpic about whether they're alive, dead, real, or imaginary. The Person class is a sub-class of the Agent class, since all people are considered 'agents' in FOAF.\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n### equivalent classes\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Person `<http://schema.org/Person>`\n- Person `<http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person>`\n\n### disjoint with\n\n`owl:disjointWith`\n\n- [Organization](#organization) `foaf:Organization`\n- [Project](#project) `foaf:Project`\n\n## name\n\n`foaf:name`\n\n```\nfoaf:name  rdf:type         rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status      \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label          \"name\" ;\n        rdfs:comment        \"A name for some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type            owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy    foaf: .\n```\n\nFOAF provides some other naming constructs. While foaf:name does not explicitly represent name substructure (family vs given etc.) it does provide a basic level of interoperability. See the issue tracker for status of work on this issue.\n\nThe name property, like all RDF properties with a range of rdfs:Literal, may be used with XMLLiteral datatyped values (multiple names are acceptable whether they are in the same langauge or not). XMLLiteral usage is not yet widely adopted. Feedback on this aspect of the FOAF design is particularly welcomed.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- Label `rdfs:label`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Literal `rdfs:Literal`\n\n## title\n\n`foaf:title`\n\n```\nfoaf:title  rdf:type      rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"title\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Title (Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr. etc)\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\nThe approriate values for title are not formally constrained, and will vary across community and context. Values such as 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Ms', 'Dr' etc. are expected.\n\n## img\n\n`foaf:img`\n\n```\nfoaf:img  rdf:type          rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status      \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label          \"image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment        \"An image that can be used to represent some thing (ie. those depictions which are particularly representative of something, eg. one's photo on a homepage).\" ;\n        rdf:type            owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy    foaf: .\n```\n\nThe img property relates a Person to a Image that represents them. Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property. This illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using any RDF vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification.

This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited! Should we consider using SPARQL queries instead, for example?\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## member\n\n`foaf:member`\n\n```\nfoaf:member  rdf:type     rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"member\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Indicates a member of a Group\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe member property relates a Group to a Agent that is a member of that group.\n\nSee Group for details and examples.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Group](#group) `foaf:Group`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## Document\n\n`foaf:Document`\n\n```\nfoaf:Document  rdf:type      rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Document\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A document.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Document class represents those things which are, broadly conceived, 'documents'.\n\nThe Image class is a sub-class of Document, since all images are documents.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Creative Work `<http://schema.org/CreativeWork>`\n\n### disjoint with\n\n`owl:disjointWith`\n\n- [Organization](#organization) `foaf:Organization`\n- [Project](#project) `foaf:Project`\n\n## Image\n\n`foaf:Image`\n\n```\nfoaf:Image  rdf:type         rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"An image.\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe class Image is a sub-class of Document corresponding to those documents which are images.\n\nDigital images (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF bitmaps, SVG diagrams etc.) are examples of Image.\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Image Object `<http://schema.org/ImageObject>`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/Semantic Web/Ontologies/MD-RDF Ontologies/FOAF/","title":"Friend of a Friend (FOAF) Core"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Friend of a Friend (FOAF) Core\n\n`<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>`\n\n```\n@prefix rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix owl:  <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n@prefix vs:  <http://www.w3.org/2003/06/sw-vocab-status/ns#> .\n@prefix foaf:  <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n@prefix wot:  <http://xmlns.com/wot/0.1/> .\n@prefix dc:  <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> .\n\nfoaf:   rdf:type        owl:Ontology ;\n        dc:title        \"Friend of a Friend (FOAF) vocabulary\" ;\n        dc:description  \"The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) RDF vocabulary, described using W3C RDF Schema and the Web Ontology Language.\" .\n```\n\nThe Friend of a Friend (FOAF) RDF vocabulary, described using W3C RDF Schema and the Web Ontology Language.\n\n[The original specification](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) is licensed under [CC BY-1.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/).\n\n#### Contents\n\n- [Agent](#agent)\n- [Person](#person)\n- [name](#name)\n- [title](#title)\n- [img](#img)\n- [depiction](#depiction)\n- [family name](#family-name)\n- [given name](#given-name)\n- [knows](#knows)\n- [based near](#based-near)\n- [age](#age)\n- [made](#made)\n- [primary topic](#primary-topic)\n- [Project](#project)\n- [Organization](#organization)\n- [Group](#group)\n- [member](#member)\n- [Document](#document)\n- [Image](#image)\n\n## Agent\n\n`foaf:Agent`\n\n```\nfoaf:Agent  rdf:type         rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Agent\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"An agent (eg. person, group, software or physical artifact).\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class .\n```\n\nThe Agent class is the class of agents; things that do stuff.

Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a depiction relation to any Image that depicts you, whereas img is typically used to indicate a few images that are particularly representative.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [depicts](#depicts) `foaf:depicts`\n\n## family name\n\n`foaf:familyName`\n\n```\nfoaf:familyName  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"familyName\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The family name of some person.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe familyName property is provided (alongside givenName) for use when describing parts of people's names.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property. This illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using any RDF vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification.

This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited! Should we consider using SPARQL queries instead, for example?\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## member\n\n`foaf:member`\n\n```\nfoaf:member  rdf:type     rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"member\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Indicates a member of a Group\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe member property relates a Group to a Agent that is a member of that group.\n\nSee Group for details and examples.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Group](#group) `foaf:Group`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## Document\n\n`foaf:Document`\n\n```\nfoaf:Document  rdf:type      rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Document\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A document.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Document class represents those things which are, broadly conceived, 'documents'.\n\nThe Image class is a sub-class of Document, since all images are documents.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Creative Work `<http://schema.org/CreativeWork>`\n\n### disjoint with\n\n`owl:disjointWith`\n\n- [Organization](#organization) `foaf:Organization`\n- [Project](#project) `foaf:Project`\n\n## Image\n\n`foaf:Image`\n\n```\nfoaf:Image  rdf:type         rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"An image.\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe class Image is a sub-class of Document corresponding to those documents which are images.\n\nDigital images (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF bitmaps, SVG diagrams etc.) are examples of Image.\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Image Object `<http://schema.org/ImageObject>`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Peace Infrastructure Project/Social Attack Vectors/Criminal Activity/Corporate Crime/","title":"Corporate Crime"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"*Chat AI:*\n\nCorporate crime refers to illegal or unethical activities that are committed by a business or corporation. These crimes can take many forms and can involve one or more parties who are engaged in activities that breach laws or duties as described by corporate governance and related laws.\n\nSome common types of corporate crime include:\n\n-   Financial crime: This can include activities such as embezzlement, money laundering, and securities fraud.\n    \n-   Environmental crime: This can include activities such as illegal dumping of hazardous waste or violation of environmental regulations.\n    \n-   Consumer fraud: This can include activities such as false advertising or selling defective products.\n    \n-   Bribery and corruption: This can include activities such as offering or accepting bribes in order to gain an unfair advantage.\n    \n-   Health and safety violations: This can include activities such as failing to provide a safe work environment or ignoring safety regulations.\n    \n\nCorporate crime can have serious consequences for both the businesses and individuals involved, as well as for society as a whole. It can undermine trust in businesses and financial systems, damage reputations, and result in significant financial losses.

The Response was as follows,\n\nCarbon credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to offset carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon credits are used as a way to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and to promote the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\nUnder a carbon credit system, a government or other authority sets a cap on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted within a specific region or sector. Companies or other organizations that exceed their allocated carbon emissions are required to purchase carbon credits from those that have emitted less than their allocated amount. This creates a market for carbon credits, with the goal of reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions and incentivizing the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\nCarbon credits can be bought and sold on carbon markets, such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) or the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). The value of carbon credits is typically based on the cost of reducing or offsetting a ton of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nOverall, carbon credits are a way to use market forces to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\n\n\n>Then, i asked,\n> Q: What are some other non-financial biosphere related currencies?\n\nThere are many types of non-financial currencies that are related to the biosphere or the natural environment.

Fungible goods or assets are interchangeable, meaning that they can be used to satisfy a debt or obligation regardless of their specific characteristics or qualities.\n\n*For example, money is a fungible asset because it can be exchanged for any other good or service of equal value. Gold is also a fungible asset because it can be traded for other gold or for other goods or services of equal value. In contrast, non-fungible goods or assets are unique and cannot be exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value. For example, a work of art or a collectible item is non-fungible because it has a unique value that cannot be replicated or replaced.*\n\n*Another term for fungibility is exchangeability. When a good or asset is exchangeable, it means that it can be traded or exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value. Exchangeability is closely related to the concept of fungibility, and the two terms are often used interchangeably to refer to the property of goods or assets that can be traded or exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value.*\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/Economic Systems/Webizen Alliance/Community of Practice/","title":"Community of Practice"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"What is a 'Community of Practice'?\n\nA Community of Practice is defined in [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) in the following way;\n\nA **community of practice** (**CoP**) is a group of people who \"share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly\".[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#cite_note-1) The concept was first proposed by [cognitive anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_anthropology \"Cognitive anthropology\") [Jean Lave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lave \"Jean Lave\") and educational theorist [Etienne Wenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etienne_Wenger \"Etienne Wenger\") in their 1991 book _Situated Learning_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)). Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWenger1998)).\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)).\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunchroom at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFDub%C3%A9BourhisJacob2005)) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFSheridan2015)). A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFKietzmannPlanggerEatonHeilgenberg2013)) is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [American pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pragmatism \"American pragmatism\"), especially [C. S. Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Peirce \"C. S. Peirce\")'s concept of the \"[community of inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_inquiry \"Community of inquiry\")\" ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFShields2003)), but also [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey \"John Dewey\")'s principle of learning through occupation ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWallace2007)).\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/Economic Systems/Webizen Alliance/The Webizen Charter/","title":"The Webizen Charter"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Charter is the web-civics version of the 3 laws of robotics or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\nIts yet to be formally defined, yet basically, its about promoting good (even if not understood at the time) whilst discouraging / punishing bad behaviours.

It is typically non-routine and requires a high level of education, training, or experience. Examples of knowledge work include research, consulting, analysis, design, and development. This type of work is often associated with information-intensive industries such as finance, technology, and education. It is typically done by professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, and scientists, and requires the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and make informed decisions.\n\nThe creation of software for the support of socio-economic ecosystems that act to preserve human rights, support the needs of workers, and protect against exploitation and other harms can be considered a form of knowledge work. This type of software development involves the use of specialized knowledge and expertise to design, develop, and maintain software systems that support these important social and economic goals.\n\nSoftware developers engaged in this type of work may be involved in the creation of systems that help to monitor and protect the rights of workers, such as by tracking working hours and ensuring fair pay. They may also work on software that helps to prevent exploitation and other forms of abuse, such as by providing tools for reporting and tracking incidents.\n\nIn addition to technical skills, knowledge work in this context may also require a deep understanding of social and economic issues, as well as a commitment to promoting and upholding human rights. The development of software to support socio-economic ecosystems requires a high level of creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking in order to create effective and sustainable solutions to complex challenges.\n\nPhilosophy, web science, and economics can all play important roles in the production of software designed to support knowledge workers.\n\nPhilosophy can help to inform the ethical and moral principles that guide the design and development of software for knowledge work. For example, the principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability may be central to the development of software that supports knowledge workers, and these principles may be grounded in philosophical theories of justice or moral reasoning.\n\nWeb science, which is the study of the structure, evolution, and use of the World Wide Web, can also be important for the production of software for knowledge work. Web science can provide insights into how people use and interact with software, as well as how to design software that is user-friendly and effective.\n\nEconomics, meanwhile, can help to inform the business and financial aspects of software development for knowledge work. This may include considerations such as the cost of development, pricing models, and the potential return on investment. Economics can also help to analyze the potential economic impacts of software for knowledge work, such as its effects on productivity and efficiency.\n\nIn relation to the activity of performing knowledge work; the amount of time it takes to comprehend and form the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to create a derivative artifact can be significantly longer than the time it takes to actually create the artifact. This is because knowledge work often involves complex, non-routine tasks that require a high level of education, training, or experience.\n\nFor example, the process of designing a concept for a web application may involve a significant amount of time spent researching and analyzing user needs, studying existing solutions, and conceptualizing and prototyping different design approaches. This process of understanding and planning can take weeks, months, or even years, depending on the complexity of the project.\n\nOn the other hand, the process of implementing the web application solution as software may involve a shorter amount of time, as it involves following a detailed plan or set of instructions to build the actual software. This implementation phase may still require a high level of skill and expertise, but it typically relies on a foundation of understanding and planning that has already been established.\n\nOverall, the amount of time it takes to comprehend and form the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to create a derivative artifact can vary greatly depending on the complexity and scope of the project. However, in general, this process of comprehension and understanding can take significantly longer than the actual process of creating the artifact.\n\nHistorically, \n\nThere are several economic methodologies that were able to be used to compensate individuals who have produced valuable works through knowledge work, even if they were not paid for their work while it was being produced. \n\nSome of those potential options included:\n\n1.  Royalties: A royalty is a payment made to the creator of a work based on the number of copies sold or the amount of revenue generated by the work. This model can be used to ensure that creators are compensated for the value that their work generates over time.\n    \n2.  Licensing: A licensing agreement allows the creator of a work to grant permission to others to use the work in exchange for a fee. This model can be used to ensure that creators are compensated for the use of their work, even if they are not directly involved in the distribution or sale of the work.\n    \n3.  Equity: In some cases, creators may be able to negotiate for an ownership stake in the company or venture that is using their work. This can provide them with a share of the profits or value generated by the work.\n    \n4.  Crowdfunding: Crowdfunding platforms allow creators to seek financial support from a large number of people, typically through small contributions. This model can be used to raise funds for the production of a work, and can also help to build a community of supporters around the work.\n    \n\n### Relationship between Fair Terms and Taxation\nIf knowledge workers are unpaid or solely funded via universal basic income (UBI), it is likely to have an impact on taxation income. UBI is a form of social security that provides a guaranteed income to all citizens, regardless of their employment status or income level.\n\nIf knowledge workers are receiving UBI as their primary source of income, it is likely that they will not be paying taxes on their income, as UBI is typically designed to be tax-free. This could reduce the overall amount of taxation income collected by the government.\n\nOn the other hand, if knowledge workers are not being paid for their work at all, it is possible that they may be reliant on other forms of government assistance, such as welfare payments or unemployment benefits. In this case, the government may still be incurring costs to support these individuals, even if they are not generating taxation income through their work.\n\nOverall, the impact of unpaid or UBI-funded knowledge workers on taxation income will depend on the specific details of the UBI program and the broader economic context.\n\n### Relationship between Economics and Intellectual Property\nIf knowledge workers who produce valuable intellectual property are not compensated or acknowledged for their contributions towards works that are later commercially exploited by others without lawful licensing rights, it can have a number of negative impacts on intellectual property rights.\n\nFirst and foremost, it can undermine the principle of fair compensation for intellectual property, which is a key aspect of intellectual property law. If knowledge workers are not being fairly compensated for their contributions, it can discourage them from continuing to create and innovate, which can have a negative impact on the overall development and growth of the field.\n\nIn addition, the unauthorized exploitation of intellectual property can also lead to disputes and legal conflicts. If knowledge workers are not properly compensated or credited for their work, they may seek legal remedies to protect their rights and seek fair compensation. This can result in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings, which can be disruptive to businesses and industries that rely on the exploitation of intellectual property.\n\nOverall, it is important to ensure that knowledge workers who produce valuable intellectual property are fairly compensated and acknowledged for their contributions. This can help to promote a healthy and vibrant intellectual property ecosystem, which is essential for fostering innovation and economic growth.\n\nIn general, it is not lawful to obtain intellectual property from a knowledge worker if they are not compensated for their work. Intellectual property law provides legal protections for the creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. These protections typically include the right to be compensated for the use of the intellectual property.\n\nIf a knowledge worker creates a work that is protected by intellectual property law, they have the right to be compensated for its use. This may include payment for the use of the work, or an agreement to share in the profits generated by the work. Without such an agreement, it is typically not lawful to use the work without the knowledge worker's consent.\n\nThere are some limited exceptions to this rule, such as the \"fair use\" doctrine in copyright law, which allows for limited use of copyrighted works without permission in certain circumstances, such as for the purpose of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, these exceptions are typically narrow and do not allow for the unrestricted use of intellectual property without compensation.\n\nOverall, it is important to ensure that knowledge workers are fairly compensated for their valuable intellectual property in order to respect their rights and promote a healthy and vibrant intellectual property ecosystem.\n\nThrough the development of the [[WorkProject]] new solutions become available.

In the context of online systems, contract law can be used to establish the terms of service for websites and other online platforms, to govern the sale of goods or services online, and to resolve disputes that may arise between parties.\n>\n>Online contracts can take many forms, including written agreements, click-through agreements, and terms of service. These contracts may be used to define the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved, as well as to set out the terms and conditions under which the contract will be performed.\n>\n>In the event of a dispute, contract law can be used to interpret the terms of an online contract and to determine the rights and obligations of the parties involved. Contract law can also be used to enforce the terms of an online contract, including through the use of damages or other remedies.\n>\n>Overall, contract law plays a critical role in modern online systems, providing a framework for regulating agreements and interactions between parties and for resolving disputes that may arise.\n\nQ: Describe the implications Choice of law in terms of service agreements for modern online systems that store the information provided by users.\n\n> A: Choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for modern online systems that store user information can have significant implications for the parties involved. These provisions can determine which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the terms of the agreement, and can therefore impact the rights and obligations of the parties.\n> \n> For example, choice of law provisions can affect the level of protection afforded to user data and the rights of users to access and control their data. They can also impact the liability of the online platform for any breaches of the terms of service or for any harm caused to users as a result of the platform's actions or failures.\n> \n> In addition, choice of law provisions can affect the enforceability of the terms of the agreement and the ability of users to bring legal actions against the online platform. They can also impact the availability of remedies for any breaches of the agreement, such as damages or injunctive relief.\n> \n> Overall, choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems that store user information can have significant implications for the rights and obligations of the parties involved and can affect the enforceability and effectiveness of the agreement.\n> \n> In order to ensure that choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems are effective and enforceable, it is important for the parties to carefully consider the jurisdiction whose laws will apply to the agreement. This may involve considering factors such as the location of the parties, the location of the online platform, and the nature of the services being provided.\n> \n> It may also be necessary to consider the laws of multiple jurisdictions, as online systems may operate globally and may be subject to the laws of multiple countries.

This could include rates of return in the range of 10-20% or higher.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these rates are only estimates, and the actual rate of return that an investor or lender is seeking may vary significantly based on the specific details of the project and the investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives. It is also worth noting that the rate of return sought by an investor or lender may not necessarily reflect the rate of return that the project is able to generate.\n\nOverall, it is important for entrepreneurs seeking funding for early stage projects to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any unsecured loans they are considering, including the rate of return being sought by the investor or lender.\n\nQ: What is the typical return on investment expectation for Early Stage Venture Capital?\n\nA: The typical return on investment (ROI) expectation for early stage venture capital can vary widely depending on a number of factors, including the stage of the company, the industry sector, and the specific investment strategy of the venture capital firm.\n\nIn general, venture capital firms that invest in early stage companies are typically seeking higher rates of return to compensate for the higher level of risk involved. According to some estimates, venture capital firms may typically aim for an ROI of 3-5 times their initial investment over a period of 5-7 years.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these are only estimates, and the actual ROI achieved by a venture capital firm may vary significantly based on the specific details of the investment. Venture capital investing is generally considered to be a high-risk, high-reward proposition, and it is not uncommon for some investments to fail to deliver any return, while others may achieve significantly higher returns.\n\nOverall, it is important for entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any investment offer, including the expected ROI and the time frame in which the venture capital firm expects to see a return on its investment.\n\n**Q:**  What would be the fixed rate of return if the compensatory amount for a successful venture was capped to a specified fixed multiplier or percentage, for an early stage project?\n\nA: The fixed rate of return if the compensatory amount for a successful venture is capped to a specified fixed multiplier or percentage for an early stage project would depend on the specific terms and conditions of the investment.\n\nFor example, if the compensatory amount is capped at a fixed multiplier of 2x the initial investment, and the initial investment is $100,000, the fixed rate of return would be 100% (2x the initial investment), assuming that the project is successful and the cap is reached.\n\nOn the other hand, if the compensatory amount is capped at a fixed percentage of the initial investment, such as 50%, and the initial investment is $100,000, the fixed rate of return would be $50,000 (50% of the initial investment), assuming that the project is successful and the cap is reached.\n\nIt is important to note that fixed multipliers and percentages can be used in a variety of different investment structures, and the specific terms and conditions of an investment will vary depending on the specific details of the project and the preferences of the investor. It is up to the investor to carefully consider the terms and conditions of the investment, including any caps on the compensatory amount, before making a decision. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/Economic Systems/WorkProject/Resources/","title":"Resources"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Resources are any materials, assets, or inputs that are used to produce goods or services.

The focus of the first stage is to deliver an ecosystem that operates on laptop & desktop machines, with the support of a low-cost server (or server-side service) that provides networking support and related features built upon the tailscale / headscale networking packages.\n\nThe use of obsidian is experimental and these product / functionality specifications are likely to be updated overtime. \n\n**HIGH LEVEL OBJECTIVES**\n\nThe high-level objective, is to create some initial open-source software packages, that provide an ability for users to either download a server-runtime that can be set-up on a VPS to support private networking support with 'client' applications that are installable on Windows & OSX in particular (also linux, but not the priority); or, that the user is able to use the 'webizen' / webcivics install that is set-up to support users.\n\nUsers then download the 'client' apps, and set them up on their local machine (ie: OSX/Windows/linux) which in-turn provides them a folder they can drop HTML5 apps written for that 'webizen server' that uses WebID-TLS (from the local host rww server) and optionally also WebID-OIDC (via the remote host / 'control server').  \n\nThe client apps are able to be written using basic HTML5 tools; and the server provides the basic 'hooks' needed to perform various functions  (described later).\n\nThe instances use semantic web technologies to create decentralised 'social' application environments.  ACLs are managed by the user, via WebID related ACLs; which are in-turn built upon the namespace (entity centric).  Local apps do not provide any data to 3rd party systems unless expressly requested to do so.  This mechanism is sought to be achieved using 'verifiable credentials' (or openbadges) related methods (alongside WAC).   The more advanced aspects of how these systems should be implemented requires an operating environment that has some apps functioning on it, in-order to further develop the semantic logic processes. \n\nIn-order to achieve that objective quickly; a method has been identified to use (and update accordingly) existing go libraries - as to achieve the objective of building a basic environment that is able to be used by people who are not necessarily software engineers (ie: might have various types of skills that are important for progress); and, until there is something that operates in a manner that exemplifies how these systems are intending to create a different sort of ecosystem, its hard to explain. \n\nNOTE:  One of the first projects sought to be developed (after the basics are done) is a 'work platform' or app / ecosystem environment. The purpose of this 'app' / ecosystem environment; is to support decentralised development of projects, including the means to attribute resource value (project costs) which may in-turn articulate to future income (roi / compensation); using dual-licensing and other complex methods, as to support the competing interests of seeking to end-up providing open and freely available software for the betterment of mankind; whilst ensuring the method employed to do so, does not breach human rights / engender 'digital slavery'.  This project is about getting long-term works to a next milestone; and one / if that is achieved, then there is still a long way to go.\n\nOUTCOME\nThe outcomes of this project seek to achieve the following objectives;\n1. Users should be able to 'sign-up' online; and,\n\ta. create an WebID-OIDC Address; and,\n\tb. connect a domainname (or are alternatively provided one)\n\tc. be provided a basic webspace (html5) that can use local graph resources.\n3. Install 'clients' that create a networking environment that supports HTTPS & WebID-TLS using that domainname.\n4. Create and/or download/install 'webizen v1 apps' (rww/solid based) onto their 'home' webizen server/client.\n\nOnce these objectives are achieved, it is considered that users will be able to 'push' resources (different acls, etc.) to different nodes (ie: from their local machine, to the 'host' that's supporting some sort of 'public webpage', blog, etc.); and that this is achieved via the 'apps' that are created on top of this 'webizen v1 platform' stack.\n\nDevelopment Tools Summary\n\nPrimary Codebase\nIn-order to develop something that works quickly, it has been found that a number of  critical functionality requirements is able to be supported by existing GoLang projects.  Alternatives have not been found using nodejs libraries or otherwise.\n\nThese libraries include; but are not limited to,\n\nClient / Server Side Packages\n\nHeadscale (https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) \nHeadscale is an opensource implementation of the TailScale Control Server.  It provides an ability for users to set-up an account via OIDC (openID connect) and initiate a private network based upon the tailscale network technologies; that can then be routed both privately and publically, using an 'exit node'\n\nTailscale (https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale) \nTailscale provides both client and server packages for networking.  It provides a private network that supports TLS & IPv4/IPv6; enabling routing through firewalls (like a vpn).  It is controlled by a 'control server', headscale is an open-source project working to build one.\n\nCaddy Server (https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)\nCaddy Server is an extensible web-server written in Go.

Other servers run [Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect) to continuously import and export data as event streams to integrate Kafka with your existing systems such as relational databases as well as other Kafka clusters. To let you implement mission-critical use cases, a Kafka cluster is highly scalable and fault-tolerant: if any of its servers fails, the other servers will take over their work to ensure continuous operations without any data loss.\n\n**Clients**: They allow you to write distributed applications and microservices that read, write, and process streams of events in parallel, at scale, and in a fault-tolerant manner even in the case of network problems or machine failures. Kafka ships with some such clients included, which are augmented by [dozens of clients](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients) provided by the Kafka community: clients are available for Java and Scala including the higher-level [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) library, for Go, Python, C/C++, and many other programming languages as well as REST APIs.\n\n#### [What is event streaming?](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_streaming)\n\nEvent streaming is the digital equivalent of the human body's central nervous system. It is the technological foundation for the 'always-on' world where businesses are increasingly software-defined and automated, and where the user of software is more software.\n\nTechnically speaking, event streaming is the practice of capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams of events; storing these event streams durably for later retrieval; manipulating, processing, and reacting to the event streams in real-time as well as retrospectively; and routing the event streams to different destination technologies as needed. Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time.\n\n#### [](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_usage)[What can I use event streaming for?](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_usage)\n\nEvent streaming is applied to a [wide variety of use cases](https://kafka.apache.org/powered-by) across a plethora of industries and organizations. Its many examples include:\n\n-   To process payments and financial transactions in real-time, such as in stock exchanges, banks, and insurances.\n-   To track and monitor cars, trucks, fleets, and shipments in real-time, such as in logistics and the automotive industry.\n-   To continuously capture and analyze sensor data from IoT devices or other equipment, such as in factories and wind parks.\n-   To collect and immediately react to customer interactions and orders, such as in retail, the hotel and travel industry, and mobile applications.\n-   To monitor patients in hospital care and predict changes in condition to ensure timely treatment in emergencies.\n-   To connect, store, and make available data produced by different divisions of a company.\n-   To serve as the foundation for data platforms, event-driven architectures, and microservices.\n\n\n#### [](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_concepts_and_terms)[Main Concepts and Terminology](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_concepts_and_terms)\n\nAn **event** records the fact that \"something happened\" in the world or in your business. It is also called record or message in the documentation. When you read or write data to Kafka, you do this in the form of events. Conceptually, an event has a key, value, timestamp, and optional metadata headers. Here's an example event:\n\n-   Event key: \"Alice\"\n-   Event value: \"Made a payment of $200 to Bob\"\n-   Event timestamp: \"Jun. 25, 2020 at 2:06 p.m.\"\n\n**Producers** are those client applications that publish (write) events to Kafka, and **consumers** are those that subscribe to (read and process) these events. In Kafka, producers and consumers are fully decoupled and agnostic of each other, which is a key design element to achieve the high scalability that Kafka is known for. For example, producers never need to wait for consumers. Kafka provides various [guarantees](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics) such as the ability to process events exactly-once.\n\nEvents are organized and durably stored in **topics**. Very simplified, a topic is similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the files in that folder. An example topic name could be \"payments\". Topics in Kafka are always multi-producer and multi-subscriber: a topic can have zero, one, or many producers that write events to it, as well as zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to these events. Events in a topic can be read as often as needed—unlike traditional messaging systems, events are not deleted after consumption. Instead, you define for how long Kafka should retain your events through a per-topic configuration setting, after which old events will be discarded. Kafka's performance is effectively constant with respect to data size, so storing data for a long time is perfectly fine.\n\nTopics are **partitioned**, meaning a topic is spread over a number of \"buckets\" located on different Kafka brokers. This distributed placement of your data is very important for scalability because it allows client applications to both read and write the data from/to many brokers at the same time. When a new event is published to a topic, it is actually appended to one of the topic's partitions. Events with the same event key (e.g., a customer or vehicle ID) are written to the same partition, and Kafka [guarantees](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics) that any consumer of a given topic-partition will always read that partition's events in exactly the same order as they were written.\n\n![](https://kafka.apache.org/images/streams-and-tables-p1_p4.png)\n\nFigure: This example topic has four partitions P1–P4. Two different producer clients are publishing, independently from each other, new events to the topic by writing events over the network to the topic's partitions. Events with the same key (denoted by their color in the figure) are written to the same partition. Note that both producers can write to the same partition if appropriate.\n\nTo make your data fault-tolerant and highly-available, every topic can be **replicated**, even across geo-regions or datacenters, so that there are always multiple brokers that have a copy of the data just in case things go wrong, you want to do maintenance on the brokers, and so on. A common production setting is a replication factor of 3, i.e., there will always be three copies of your data. This replication is performed at the level of topic-partitions.\n\nThis primer should be sufficient for an introduction. The [Design](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#design) section of the documentation explains Kafka's various concepts in full detail, if you are interested.\n \nSource: [apache kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) "},{"fields":{"slug":"/use-cases/Webizen/Host Service Requirements/Database requirements/Database Alternatives/CayleyGraph/","title":"CayleyGraph"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Cayley is an open-source database for [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data).

It provides a rapidly scalable solution to international alternative networks like facebook, twitter, nationbuilder and the many others. \n\nWeb Civics has been designed over many years to develop as an organisational structure of instrumental importance to these economic, legal and political needs.  The purpose of this body of work is to significantly re-engineer the means through which the collective wisdom, of mankind is able to be made use of for any purpose whatsoever.  \n\nIt has a design philosophy that is centred upon a field of ‘web science’ and the practical socio economic utility of online civics projects as to collaboratively forge solutions.  Web Civics works to establish a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that makes the data about people useful for the people; as any future knowledge equity ecosystem, depends upon the people and its means to serve us.\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\nI, Timothy Holborn have been working on the development knowledge economy business models predicated upon design works for an innovative information management framework since 2000. The purpose of these works has been to create as to make use of online systems to produce a ‘knowledge banking’ industry whereby through the specified use of specified technology.  The problem these works have sought to resolve, is to provide the technical and socioeconomic means for a natural persons to be the primary beneficiary of the information management systems used to store and make use of their data.  \n\nThe heart of this work has always been focused upon the means through which the designs to uplift the way older institutional systems, such as banking and telecommunications, can be uplifted via ICT for the betterment of society.   The socioeconomic terms through which a natural person's life depends, is built upon the means for statements in records & verifiable facts can be assumed to be applied legitimately to a person.\n\nOur information systems have not been designed to provide useful informatics environments to natural persons who are the primary stakeholders for whom information concerning them is of most importance.  \n\nA knowledge banking industry provides its account holders ‘knowledge services’, which stems from the technical means through which data is stored in a format designed to ensure it can be employed as useful information, through technology standards.  These environments when applied to humans are called ‘inforgs’ and is instrumentally required for good governance of legal personalities and broader socio economic issues.\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u2kzBT8g44l2hcm-Dw4xETKoaHGHjyBluMyNwvkRO8ov9LWn6YTFWzj7so_v4GqL82n3_1epeSxfsSdhPl7wAZbdIEKFdgkdiAVV-4hjdBbt5rxeiItXY-ltg0JXIUJWFB_ms09f2HFc7JBvEytsDb688e60fFdMEREn4Kej4G2L5X4OxWbcDOxRVAMW)\n\nThrough the use of these ‘inforg environments’ online computational services are designed to promote human interoperability with online information as to ensure the knowledge frameworks.  This is operated through dynamic AI agents that are instrumentally designed by the owner of the inforg and are relied upon in decision making practices.  The practice method of programming these design decisions, the computationally stored personal choices made by the human or data subject, creates a ‘knowledge banking account environment’.\n\nA person's knowledge bank provides them an inclusive means as affected natural persons to be made able to be involved as best as is made possible by way of online systems.  Tools are provided to equip their sense of wisdom to program their own ‘inforg’ to represent knowledge of them, knowledge about them, knowledge as is made to be able to be communicated by them; as to be employed by all other agents in the infosphere.\n\nBut today, there is no such ‘knowledge banking industry’, We have no interconnectable ‘informatics environment’ that does anything like the functional capacities of institutional systems; that can be considered to be made our own, as natural persons.  \n\nSince 2000 i have been working on how to establish the technical frameworks required to make systems that can be beneficially owned by humans with similar principles to money in a bank; if you don’t like the bank, you can put your money elsewhere & the bank exists for the principle purpose of supporting your financial needs. Knowledge banks are different as they influence not only what choices you are able to have made available to you; but also, the basis upon which you are best empowered to choose anything. \n\nThe underlying works have required years of dedicated efforts by a relatively small group of people, worldwide.  Now, the technical standards have now been done and the next stage is to commence the development of market-facing tools that make use of the works that have been produced internationally as to deliver the opportunity.  The opportunity framework is considered to have been designed by me, timothy holborn, whilst I have worked with many internationally to develop instrumentally important components.\n\nThe next most instrumental step, is to establish ‘human identity’ enabled semantic communications infrastructure points with the use of the open-standards based online technology ecosystem able to support a knowledge banking industry.  Web Civics is designed to compliment the broader ecosystem of global (internet) governance, to support - web civics; the works required for our natural world.\n\n  \n  \n\n## INCORPORATED DEVELOPMENT AND FRAMEWORK STRATEGY OUTLINE\n\nThe organisational strategy is to establish the organisation, build, test and refine its ecosystem frameworks and upon a basis of having initial successful operating technology powered solutions; to undertake an Australian Crowd Sourced Equity Finance round that is intended to enable international expansion of Web Civics, whilst demonstrating Australia to be the best place to lead it. \n\nTo achieve this, the organisation needs to be established and resourced as to convert the business systems designs into an operating business model. This in-turn requires a task to initially focus on to bring Web Civics together, technically. \n\nTo technically apply its methodologies to develop both internationally and with external stakeholders; in establishing its ecosystem, the Go to Market approach builds a mobile application and CMS tools that enable permissively interconnectable online systems between online application frameworks.  The means through which this is done also provides locally authenticated access systems that are distinct to pre-existing alternatives such as facebook, google, twitter and other OAUTH2 providers.\n\nThe first, simple example of how these systems work will be produced to work with Wordpress and related ecosystem tools that are designed to work with a ‘solid based’ mobile app, that incorporates ‘verifiable claims’ and related ecosystem tools that have been developed as standardised interoperable components.  \n\n### Commercial Structures: Go To Market Approach\n\nAs Web Civics is designed to produce incubated works that are intended to support the further creation of a knowledge banking industry the broader frameworks required to bring this about do in-turn require web civics to be formulated with an array of particular techniques that support its means to be fit for purpose.  These are some considerations relating to my works on business system ecosystems (inc. alliancing strategies, co-ops, mission based organisational structures, etc); and here are a draft outline of those considerations with respect to Web Civics. \n\nWeb Civics essentially provides constituent of its productivity does in-turn produce open-source software that requires;\n\n1.  A licensing framework.  This licensing framework needs to address the means through which the software produced by web civics is made able to be used in a manner that preserves the needs of the users of that software.  The principle for how this is to be made to work is to ensure the application provider has no beneficial interest or right to make use of the data for their own commercial purpose in a manner that excludes or is not expressly permitted by the application user; or as would be the case in-time, the knowledge banking account holder.  \n    \n2.  Australian Corporations Act - Constitution Considerations.  Whilst it is the case that works appear to be underway in the USA to form a framework of ‘information fiduciaries’ this does not appear to have started here in Australia; Thereby considerations made include the following,\n    \n\n1.  Australian Law seemingly provides a poor legislative framework for the means through which our system of law is made able to uphold human rights, or the means to protect an individual's rights to the beneficial ownership of the information required to uphold any legal right, via a court of law if / as required.  \n    \n2.  As the ecosystem components are modified, the role of directors for web civics as the institutional governance institution will require terms in the organisations constitution as to ensure directors of the organisation are made able to be bound to the intended social purpose of the organisation and its ecosystems structures.  \n    \n3.  The means through which this problem is being addressed is by producing the information / data | knowledge / wisdom frameworks that support the means for persons to have the tools they need in the age of the knowledge economy in its form of being facilitated via information management systems.\n    \n\n1.  The systems being produced, innovated and developed by web civics changes the technical and socioeconomic architecture of how information management systems as to incorporate natural persons in the already international instrumental market-sphere of knowledge based capital. \n    \n2.   The Considerations that need to be made with respect to the format of the constitution of web civics are centred upon the need to consider what citizens need if a ‘hosting service’ (as an illustratively generic term) supporting Artificial intelligence systems of its account holders was able to store and beneficially make use of queries that may employ all the tracking data of the user, their health and transactional data (ie: digital point of sale receipts, open-banking, etc.), their correspondence and interactions with others, the ‘verifiable claims’ that relate to them and the permission instruments used to connect with other software agents (websites, IoT, WiFi, etc.);  as can be employed cumulatively by specified machine-readable for some specified purpose; such as an analytical render for,\n    \n\n1.  The purposes of healthcare\n    \n2.  The purpose of protecting the person from unlawful harms that threaten their safety and/or wellbeing in a manner that can be made known to be cause for concern due to illegality\n    \n3.  Proof of facts - which provides the framework for socio economic Participation. such as to include the use of their information to;\n    \n\n1.  Get a job\n    \n2.  Economically benefit from the use of works they’ve done, made useful by others\n    \n3.  Produce new applications that support their means to be paid for doing work.\n    \n4.  facilitate the limited disclosure of pertinent facts require in relation to socioeconomic frameworks to electronically support the means in which something is able to be achieved.\n    \n\n5.     The ability to cumulatively process a stream of smaller payments into a merged payment\n    \n\n5.  The mechanics it requires to ensure international constituent entities established as a result of good efforts brought about by Web Civics in Australia are able to act and support international market development with autonomy whilst binding any such international initiatives to a joint commitments that include;\n    \n\n1.  To work on shared social infrastructure needs cooperatively; and,\n    \n2.  That the significant international meeting where the decisions are made (ie: on an annual or biannual basis) be held in New South Wales Australia or the Australian Capital Territory; save exceptional circumstances.  \n    \n3.  That Web Civics entities be committed to its role in fostering knowledge banking industry based ecosystems\n    \n4.  That the role of Web Civics is to support and promote the interoperability needs of these industry frameworks and to ensure the derivative outcomes of these works forge a human centric web. \n    \n\n7.  The design of the corporate structure is purposefully formed to define a social-enterprise that employs the mission model frameworks ordinarily managed as a non-profit, whilst making use of a for-profit structure that makes use of share class structures to accommodate cooperative decision making, institutional operational frameworks that provide a reasonable basis to operate its trusted services design curation role; and the means, to support those who contribute to obtain economic benefit for having done so, in a manner that preserves and supports the mission, purposeful and usefulness of Web Civics. \n    \n\n1.  The share class structure needs to support multiple share classes that suit the needs of stakeholder classes.\n    \n2.  The share issuance structure needs to support dynamic equity models for temporal share-holdings held in-trust during the course of the operation of an agreement through to its conclusion.  This may be brought about by way of specified rules relating to (a) specified share class(s) or some other method.  There are a number of use-cases where this form of mechanism may be brought about alongside others that i may not have the relevant expertise to understand as to be viable alternatives.\n    \n3.  The share class structure must support ‘founder class’ shares or similar.\n    \n4.  The share class methodology is designed to provide a ‘proof of stake’ like mechanism for corporate governance of Web Civics; pursuant to the fit and proper use of shares as a basis through which participatory involvement is made available; pursuant to the needs of manufacturing a human centric web.\n    \n5.  Voting frameworks need to be produced as to ensure engagement in decisions of particular classes may be carried out in a trusted format through the use of trusted online engagement frameworks.   These frameworks are instrumental to the means through which web civics is first established and the capacities it both employs itself; and makes available for others to use online. \n    \n\n4.  Human Centric Web: The concept of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ is specifically designed to cater for a concept that is termed to be a ‘human centric web’; which can be described as the means to support the needs of human to manage their ‘inforg’ and the development of ‘human centric internet’ business systems.  In latin, the term for ‘human’ is “wise man” (homo sapien); yet the means to ensure our social apparatus is producing reliable information is now void.  It is imperative that we solve this problem. \n    \n\n1.  Web Civics builds its technical solutions for a human centric web by using internationally protected patent-pools providing the technology standards tools on a royalty free basis for use by natural persons.    \n    \n2.  Web Civics is committed to supporting the development and delivery of tools for decentralising the discovery, maintenance and unencumbered use of commons infrastructure in a manner that advances the meaningful utility of this new medium to advance these underlying concepts from the ecosystem norms in previous generations to the delivery of vast improvements as to empower humanity to forge the next.  Commons infrastructure as required in machine-readable formats includes support for;\n    \n\n1.  Natural world objects and related ‘informatics’ on both the microscopic and macroscopic levels\n    \n2.  Social infrastructure systems required for personhood (inc. civic participation); as to include,\n    \n\n1.  Language\n    \n2.  Law\n    \n3.  geospatial informatics (scaffolding systems)\n    \n4.  The tools required to participate and protect one's own rights in both online and offline environments.\n    \n5.  the means to support and manage trusted relations and informatics frameworks as are instrumentally required to support any of the above.\n    \n6.

We have trusted data, information that is good enough for a court of law - stored in it, that is not available to citizens because it is inconvenient to criminals operating weapons of mass harm, as information management system powered business models seek to exploit others with impunity to make money. \n\nAs a result of the means, through which the leadership of such persons involved have been allowed to remain; this is a dangerous and difficult path that does in-turn require an array of framework requirements - if we are able to remedy the situation and at the very least; ensure the tools to identify whether we are being mislead whilst being provided information used to warrants our action in relation to others on matters affecting others in any particular way.  For these reasons most believe in blockchain, i do not.\n\nMy designs produce what is called an ‘inforg’ and through the management of these ‘inforgs’ social encryption, is brought about in a format that through its use of other systems both tangibly identifiable within the network alongside those that are not, creates a form of ‘truth serum’ that i believe is not simply quantum computing resistant but moreover, able to illustrate more about our world \n\n## Business Systems Strategy:  What Web Civics will be doing.\n\nWeb Civics will be seeking to establish commercial arrangements with interested parties who are able to assist in the establishment of Web Civics as an incorporated unlisted public company; and through that, develop the foundational software tools and systems required to make everything else work.  A simplification of the basic tools presents that Web Civics will be developing as to make useful for its own purposes; and those of others, A series of software based frameworks whereby licensing will be available via web civics for civics based works. \n\nInstrumental this will include a mobile application landscape alongside software that is designed to enable the use of WordPress; and if interest & support is identified to do so, Drupal, Silverstripe, Owncloud / Nextcloud and other PHP based Content management systems; as to support the ‘knowledge banking systems’ apparatus framework as a demonstrable solution that is able to be used by Web Civics, its members / Web Civics participants; alongside others who may seek to use the software produced by Web Civics for their own purposes, whilst support being made beneficially available for civics related applications.  \n\nWhich include; but are not limited to,\n\n-   Personal Use: The online web civics platform is instrumentally defined for the purpose of providing independent persons the means to have an online information management system that is owned, defined and operated by them.  They’re able to link with others, share online resources and manage their means to communicate with others.  \n    \n-   Communities:  The web civics frameworks will provide  community management solution that includes the means for community groups to syndicate content between communities for the purpose of collaboration, improved knowledge-management and community development.\n    \n-   Civics Knowledge management; it is the case that there are many government departments, political representatives, community organisations, NGOs, GLAM, Education and others whose roles are important parts of civics apparatus who now suffer from a lack of advanced, semantic technology powered, knowledge management systems. \n    \n\nThe Web Civics technology ecosystem frameworks are being produced in a format that is built upon an integrated approach between multiple w3c centred semantic web component frameworks; that can as easily be used by an individual to form and curate their own ‘knowledge management framework’ as it is also able to be used by groups to create and curate their own; through the interconnection of web-services, via a framework that is built upon web-standards, as to create an unencumbered knowledge networking layer built upon similar technologies as are already used to power the international alternatives, such as search providers and social networks such as facebook. Users are able to define their own semantic inferencing techniques to dynamically manage content accessibility to others; alongside their ability to both define their own ontological frameworks an the means through which their ontological frameworks are made to be interoperable with others, permissively.\n\nThese systems bring about distinctions in that they’re being produced in a manner that results in the authentication and data management frameworks is citizen-centric; and standards based, as to support portability.  \n\nThrough an integrated engineering method for employing W3C standards works that include; web payments, verifiable claims and decentralised ledger technologies, in a specified way - the use of this environment is being geared to support the incremental development of projects by communities using systems that support economic rules and payments; alongside the means to extend the use of these online environment into frameworks that support geospatial awareness and ontological rules being defined to agents on a basis of who what & where; and the means to create and contribute towards new projects for shared reward structures.  \n\n### ECONOMICS:  Payment methodologies\n\nThe solution will develop a framework where particular topics can be collaboratively developed in association to a defined ledger framework that enables the permissive distribution of funds using ontologically defined rules.\n\nThis methodology is in its full-embodiment, quite sophisticated.  As such, the initial objective will be to ensure projects relating to the development of new software functions relating to the projects brought about by web civics participants; are ablate be collaboratively / cooperatively developed and funded using a series of business systems frameworks that are designed to support workers whilst capping the returns of ‘web civics’ software to a civics orientated ‘return on investment’; whereby future use thereafter is then made to be more freely available.\n\nThis ecosystem does in-turn require users to have a payment gateway where they are able to receive funds.  In-turn the software ecosystem being established via the mobile app; can in-turn, bring about the means to foster new applications such as a decentralised version / interface to offer alternatives to existing online solutions like ebay, uber, airbnb, various event ticketing systems, etc.  \n\n#### Importance of the Mobile App\n\nThe mobile app is based upon the international project called ‘solid’ as has been incubated, to be developed overtime as ‘read-write-web’; in addition to, related projects such as verifiable claims, credentials and linked data platform amongst others.  \n\nThe app will test the feasibility of providing a mobile only means for persons to be able to engage in these online systems, whereby it is intended overtime that ‘knowledge banks’ will develop further and in the more foreseeable future; the use of a wordpress site will make it relatively easy for web civics users to extend what they do via their mobile app, to a more reliable online environment. \n\nThe mobile app is intended to have the capacity to act as a server.  \n\n1.  The account management frameworks otherwise facilitated by way of the smartphone interface, are intended to be made useful on a desktop, by using the mobile phone as a web-server in a locally connected network. \n    \n2.  The Authentication mechanism is designed to support federal government services in the first instance.  The importance of this is to render support for authoritative use of the online inforg environment by the user.\n    \n3.  The user is able to encrypt and upload a copy of the information stored on their phone to an online cloud provider using their federal government credentials to support the decrypt ability of their information by them. \n    \n\nThe mobile phone can make use of the sensors in the phone to support various functions.  It is able to present an identifier using various formats (ie: QR code) and is able to read various identifiers from various systems (pending integration by providers).  It is able to support to demonstrate their means to verify they’re over 18 or other authoritative claims.  The functionality is able to be extended by way of normalised HTML5 based apps that provide standardised ontological frameworks via a UI that has been produced to work with the app. \n\nThe app will support the means for people to comment about 3rd party links using structured data. These semantic frameworks will be stored permissively as RDF and are able to be extended via their online systems.\n\nThe mobile app produced as a result of this first stage seeks to demonstrate a far broader concept, well.  It is not designed to provide all of the functional design frameworks it is hoped these inforg orientated ‘knowledge banking’ ecosystems will develop overtime; rather, it is designed to be a ‘proof of concept’ functional starting point that is useful, and able to be made use of by others to extend the functionality, frameworks and supported features via web civics related works or otherwise.  \n\nThe critical feature required is to bring about the functional requirements needed to demonstrate how ‘web civics’ can work and by doing so; providing the tools, the community and the opportunity for others to make use of the the systems produced by web civics to demonstrate how these systems work at a functional, yet basic level.\n\n## History of Web Civics\n\nWeb Civics was set-up as a trading name circa 2014. The problem the Web Civics concept was established to  resolve was that the existing internet governance groups do not produce ‘working code’ or similarly functional outputs that are needed to change the web works for humanity.  The implication of not having this ‘civics infrastructure’ has been that works produced online have been made to economically benefit the producer of online services; in a narrow and increasingly damaging way, to society; as a result of our joint inability, to fund work that can easily be used by others to incrementally change how our information systems work.\n\n  \n\nThe operational context intended to be brought about by web-civics; is to establish a social-entrepreneurship vehicle that built the technology products needed to ensure people are able to own their data, and that business / government (enterprise & organisations) are then; in-turn, able to make use of it.  \n\n  \n\nThe most instrumental example; is the ability to ensure people have a place to privately store their data.  In extension to this concept, the same requirement is needed for small groups, such as community groups, those involved in civics such as those running for public office or those who are in public office. Others include heritage organisations; alongside small businesses, where the means for them to be supported in providing an independent ‘online shop-front’ requires tools for them to be made able to use easily.\n\n  \n\nOther examples of ‘web civics’ includes the means to address issues relating to the availability of ‘public data’, the ability to identify (and make use of) legal agreement templates; and other ‘civic’ needs in relation to the means for civil society and small business to engage in the knowledge economy. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to seek the ‘start-up capital’ required to set-up Web Civics as an operational vehicle with the resources needed to build and deliver meaningfully useful products to the community.  \n\n  \n\nThe budget for producing the initial software systems is ~$100k AUD and it is expected that the additional costs should amount to a minimum of an additional $150k AUD between now and the worst case scenario for what has been able to be achieved by the time the organisation seeks to undertake crowd-source equity financing round.   It is also understood that should more funding be made available, Web Civics is able to make good use of it.\n\nWeb Civics has engaged [https://www.surroundaustralia.com/](https://www.surroundaustralia.com/) as a lead software development partner to facilitate the software development and related oversight requirements of these Web Civics projects; notwithstanding its broader mission to ensure that we are actively engaging and encouraging the development of a community and economic ecosystem around the frameworks being first established by web civics. \n\nThe website [au.webcivics.net](http://au.webcivics.net) has been establishing some initial POC wireframe evaluation works and an instance of onlyoffice is currently in the works to be securely set-up and tested, ideally also these works would also extend to a secure VOIP based WebRTC service.   It is considered that Web Civics will be able to attract revenue through a membership program (inc. supporter / ambassadors)  which is expected to carry the organisation into profitable operations between now and what is hoped to be a successful crowd-sourced equity finance round in Australia, which would in-turn support the means for further growth and international expansion.\n\n## SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe practice method employed by web civics takes into account the need to address some of the rudimentary underlying issues that are disaffecting those amongst the socioeconomic groups deemed to be most vulnerable. \n\nPrior to building solutions that may best be applied for the purposes of healthcare, we need to ensure the environment through which we intend to do so; is built in a manner that has evolved as to maintain good hygiene. \n\n### Broader socio-economic impacts\n\nThe inability for people to make use of micropayment related infrastructure as could relate to their field of endeavour, leads to a situation where people are doing a lot of work freely (which has no economic attribution) alongside the emergence of new types of work (ie: ‘gig economy’) which is in-turn causing problems to our economic landscape.  The means to resolve this relates to a framework through which technology is used to ensure civilians are socioeconomically able to engage as individuals, rather than simply, as consumers for proprietary products and online services that have as yet failed to provide the means needed by them to better socioeconomically participate; and in so doing, form means to communicate ‘verifiable claims’ socially, with others.   The tooling that is to be produced as a result of these works; is designed, to address these issues.\n\n### Business / Technical - Goals\n\nThe first problem web civics will be targeting through the application of its works, will be to produce a solution that improves the means for citizens to engage with their system of democracy and their ability to contribute towards online works of importance to community, or as considered otherwise - ‘web civics’  \n\nThe application of the technology ecosystem, is not made to be specifically used for any one particular field of application; nonetheless, our system of democracy is currently known to be suffering from an array of issues that best be addressed. \n\nIt is the goal of Web Civics in the first instance; to employ ‘start-up funding’ to deploy ‘open-source apps’ (as best as is practically viable to do so) and to target the approach, to civic participation and engagement. \n\n#### The Smart-Phone Apps\n\nThe vast majority of Australians now use high-power smart-phones, but are unlikely to have their own web hosting system. The production of smart-phone applications that support their means to engage with others both through the information provided by their smart-phones and their websites (groups in particular) \n\nWhere this is applied to corporate governance and/or the website solutions used by those seeking political election and/or those representing an electorate and/or group; the functional elements are intended to support the means for citizens to connect and engage in topics to support themselves and others, by being better made blue to work collaboratively with others on a particular topic / problem. \n\nCitizens will be able to assist with the contextual development of surveys and other materials required by those in the community who are alerting others to issues that are of importance to them; and in seeking they be reviewed, and as a consequence of the beneficial use of the web civics tools, ensure elected representatives whose job it is to support them are better equipped to make full use of the knowledge produced with others, to do their job.\n\nThis in-turn; requires a means to identify those participating; and the means to provide safe and secure systems for managing data across a decentralised system.  As such, It will, produce ‘reputation graphs’ that will continuously evolve overtime.  This structural challenge will require work;  It will need to work to do things such as, identifying how someone may relate to ‘lobby groups’ or other apparatus that may be being made use of to sway law in a way that does not represent the interests of the people.  \n\nThese ‘reputation graphs’ are essential, and will require study to ensure a ‘fit for purpose’ result. This in-turn is responded to by forming means through which people start to define their own ontological frameworks that are in-turn used, to define a broader ontological approach to forming a faceted social-equity framework that is sufficiently flexible, dependable and well studied.\n\n##### Engaging seniors\n\nSeniors, in particular,  will require assistance improving their knowledge of how best to make use of online systems of any kind. \n\nShould it be the case, they do not have the means to use a mobile app; A constituent consideration of ‘web civics’ is that It may be the case that employment opportunities might be produced; where young people, could be provided a small amount of money by seniors seeking their help to engage in issues; these are some of the many areas needed to be explored in defining a business system that is web civics based. These ‘social equity’ business systems are described in more detail below (“Socioeconomics - Knowledge Equity Systems”) whilst not exhaustively.  \n\nThereafter also; the mobile software also considers the future opportunities brought about by being able to connect to TV for engagement with FreeTV in addition to ChromeCast and AppleTV devices.  There are intrinsic considerations relating to the availability of wordpress based HbbTV solutions (“Freeview””) that are just some of the considerations sought to be processed within the operational environment product by Web Civics in the first instance; as to be better addressed, further down the track.  \n\n#### National Security - local informatics design - incorporated thinking\n\nIt is important that our information systems be developed in manner that is supportive of our means to communicate, cooperate, collaborate and resolve emergencies.\n\nThe solution has been designed to work even if parts of the international or national networks become no-longer operation. If the comms go down internationally; the site, powered by the phone - still works, and is able to network with others in the network accessible environment. These sorts of design issues are far less of a problem in places such as the USA where existing tools exist.\n\nThe framework is designed to support this internationally;  The sites employ modern ‘semantic web’ standards infrastructure; that in-turn provides the ability to link between sites and provide a decentralised information management infrastructure solution.  The solutions framework is strategically defined as to form a ‘builder’ mentality around the definition of a ‘knowledge banking industries’ that are designed to make a significant impact on the GDP via various landscapes, whilst very much focused on the cyber frameworks for the democratisation of knowledge equity; across multi-tenanted, dynamic environments.\n\nThe decentralised nature of the environment leads to the means for the discovery of content to be made independent to any particular data host. The semantic frameworks, build the purpose to develop (and support) sophisticated AI related analytics capabilities on a domestic basis.  The organisational approach is to establish a suitably defined hybrid trust structure, where hosts are stakeholders in the hybrid trust making use of dynamic equity frameworks; as to form a ‘co-op’ method. it is considered that sensitive systems will be developed elsewhere, benefiting from the instrumental works facilitated by way of Web Civics for capability development.\n\n## FUNDING, FORECASTS AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n### Leadership\n\nThe opportunity matrix is only possible if its set-up with a world-class crew to be the custodians of it; and in-turn, those people must form for themselves and their own capacity; a comprehensive understanding, of what it is; and therefore, what sorts of things it needs in-order to best protect and support it; vs. what harms it.\n\nThe engagement method sought to be instituted asap is based upon dynamic equity. In this way, the means to assess and address the balance between what people say they’ll do; and what they do, can be instituted into the financial management of the entity.\n\nInternationally ICT industry world-leaders are already well versed and competitively working toward the delivery of component and/or constituent solutions.  It is believed we have the capacity to cooperatively support each other.\n\n### ESTABLISHING THE OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK \n\nTo successfully establish this organisation; as to enable global growth,  It’ll best be served by being made able to acquire the interests / talents of a specified group of people internationally; when it is able to do so.  These individuals are artificial intelligence / intelligence systems experts worldwide; who care most, about humanity.\n\nThe organisation will require a team of developers who are not simply able to code; but moreover, able to manage code-projects done by external resources world-wide.   Once the basic tools have been made (centred upon the use of a mobile app) a ‘software as a utility’ framework emerges; making use of ledger technology, that in-turn requires an authentication methodology that serves to protect the cryptographic instruments (private keys) used by ledgers.  Once this is in-place, the means for people to collaborate in all sorts of ways, changes the (knowledge) economics.  These ecosystem foundations rapidly develop the means to produce complex ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’ capabilities such as natural language processing, AI automation, etc. \n\nIt is the purpose of web civics to set-up the frameworks we require to manage these systems effectively. \n\nIn-order to make use of public data (ie: legislation libraries, public data for statistical review, etc.) frameworks need to be established that provide a generic and simplified means for people to justify (and support) statements through the use of data-sources.  This in-turn also requires an array of data-sources to be made available as RDF; which in-turn, requires some thinking about how this best be done in a permissive ecosystem structure.\n\nThe purpose of the web civics start-up practice method methodology is to ensure we are able to best attend to these foundation level organisational needs; as to ensure the organisation is best made able to strategically scale.  The end result (out of scope for the purpose of this document); is that community groups should be able to work together to build ‘smart-ups’ and that the underlying framework has been set-out in a manner that can more easily be rapidly understood by stakeholders in Australia and abroad to be capable of developing a business systems framework that is complementary to existing international internet governance frameworks, for the rapid development of a human centric web to control AI, build upon an international knowledge banking industry to stabilise & enhance well developed knowledge based capital trade, internationally, to inclusively support humanity.\n\n## System of Government\n\nOur system of government, in Australia, has both state and federal governments represented in our constitution; whilst local government is by way of the constitution, identified to be an instrument of the state.  Party politics is known to be causing issues as is the lack of interfaces provided to the public to engage with the policies promoted by their elected members of parliament as to have their voices be made to be heard.\n\nThe simple means for individuals to send through a response like ‘i support this’ or ‘i do not support this’ is not provided electronically; and for the most part, engagement is currently facilitated by way of online channels; provided by international organisations such as facebook, twitter and instagram that augmented by their needs for advertising revenue.  The design paradigm for a civics engagement strategy is quite different.\n\nThe system of government, as a participatory system of democracy is well suited defining needs of others internationally.  We have an array of different challenges within our region, which can aid education overseas.\n\n### Education (EXAMPLE: SYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY)\n\nIt is the case, that the vast majority of Australians do not understand how our system of democracy works.  Much of our media presents stories that have been produced by organisations internationally, particularly the USA and the UK.  People who are seeking to engage in our system of democracy, need to learn how it is they’re made able to do so; and where / how, their efforts best be channelled to relevant stakeholders in appropriate and meaningful ways.  \n\nTherein; there are a few related requirements,\n\n1.  People don’t know how our system of democracy works today.  Educational material needs to be provided to change this situation and provide the tooling required, to ensure no reasonable circumstances are afforded to the electorate as to warrant their means to not understand how to engage in their system of democracy.\n    \n2.  Our online tooling needs to be assistive.  We can use ‘ontological data’ (RDF / OWL, etc.) to ensure queries are directed to the appropriate place, in the appropriate way; and that, what may otherwise become a vast amount of complaints about a similar issue; be processed using ‘Artificial intelligence’ systems to analyse the underlying problems in context to the proportionate constraints and environmental relationships to other issues. \n    \n3.  Law, needs to be inscribed in machine-readable formats; alongside other “AI materials” required to analyse communications and convert to machine-readable / ‘knowledge graphs’ made comprehendible to stakeholders.\n    \n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ppcd7nxB659l5KQCxNrHRnO3cvtgB1bvCq5cb4jIMI2JfpIC4-nSQckG5YTiWHs81lOwjxFxzXdFsQux97gI656sYHotiOXgps6W-onE0HLeqgoD5KRplJE_lCXm2eXrqS2hNdDzymyfD8tqBz7MHBeexMvaej1A6RcdwWrl7S5TULUQBXooD9o8yURq)\n\nThe importance of developing ‘commons infrastructure’ is integral to being made able to demonstrating how and why the design requirements of information managements systems is instrumental to ensuring no undue influence is made able in any way online; as is currently a problem as bad-actors persuade particular decisions, in our system of democracy & our system of government.  \n\nWe as Australians live unto the means through which we define and manage our frameworks defined to be ‘rule of law’. To support Rule of Law, we need technology ecosystem that support web based civics works that will provide the means for us to do so.\n\n## Future application of knowledge banking infrastructure \n\nIt is the purpose of web civics to assist in the development of knowledge banking industries. Whilst the idea is believed to be my own (has been well tested, and is still considered to be my own) the landscape is competitive and all too often, foolishly so. Those most responsible for the damage are all too often those who seem to have vanished when the time comes for responsible parties to fix the problem. If the practice method involved in fixing the problem looks like there's money involved, back those bad actors come again for another round; making instrumental use of a a behavioural paradigm that exploitatively employs socioeconomic flaws.\n\nThe problems are widespread.  In Australia, “The research estimates that 2.3 million Australian workers now partially or entirely fall outside of superannuation coverage which equates to around $10 billion in missed superannuation payments each year.” and the case as it is today in other areas that include but are not limited to health; feature far more concerning trends, no good for anyone.\n\nBefore we are able to solve some of these very troubling problems; we first need to establish the new ‘ecosystems’ in a trusted way.  The means to do this is relatively straightforward and able to scale very rapidly.  Amongst the problems less able to rapidly scale are the means through which others start to learn how to use, define & rely upon information systems that are not globally centralised or organisationally centralised;  that will in-turn require new laws, new innovative thinking from healthy people, able make decisions.\n\n## Technical Overview\n\nAny other goal of web civics and its mean to positively support the needs of others, does in-turn require tools that make use of linked-data systems in a way that empowers users to engage using semantics in a solid compatible way.  To achieve this there are some basic requirements.  The first requirement is to ensure those who seek to get involved have a personally controllable ‘pod’; or place to store and make use of their personal information.  The second constituent is to have an online solution that is easy to install, easy to set-up and made easy to use for the vast majority of people who are sufficiently capable of being early adopters.\n\nThese technical solutions aim to deliver a technical demonstration of what it is generally we are talking about.\n\n### Mobile\n\nThe mobile app is designed to provide what is essentially a smart-phone based personal solid server. The app supports solid app data and the means to produce apps for the mobile app environment, as to improve and customise the user-experience.  The app framework is also designed to be easily integrated with the web environment, to be initially produced using the wordpress CMS.\n\n#### FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n##### AUTH\n\nThe application should support both WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. The reason why both are requested is that the semantics relating to the WebID-TLS certificate is assigned to the phone as to provide mobile AUTH where  required (ie: public wifi hotspots) and the WebID-OIDC interoperability is about providing AUTH relating to the user.   \n\nThe WebID-OIDC method should include the ability to Authenticate against a national ID service provider (ie: GovPass in AU, RealMe in NZ) alongside the means to authenticate against a service provider.  The example produced earlier shows 2nd factor (being a pre-authenticated TLS cert or a SMS / MMS ) alongside the provider; being the top level domain being authenticate against; persona, being the account and passcode being password.\n\nThe mobile app environment also needs to be able to present a challenge / auth mechanism for connecting to / with other foaf:agents.  This can be in the form of a WebID via a QR Code; or a credential that creates a Authentication profile for communicating between mobile and online peers.  \n\n#### Software Development Principles\n\nPrinciple 1:  There is a distinction between a person and a device.\n\nThe WebID-TLS methodologies are designed to support device access rather than being more specific about the user of that device.  Therein; the users semantics relates to devices at the web-layer, but uses WebID-OIDC to create an extraction layer that enable them to assert specific semantics in relation to them as a person or agent (ie: employee) and the use of both creates a framework that enables semantic addressability.  \n\nPrinciple 2: A ‘Human Centric Web’ must recognise the distinctions in the roles of a person as an independent being; and, any & all roles that may provide others, in their participation in groups (ie: employee).\n\nOften it is the case that people are ‘logged in’ both as natural persons and as employees.  The semantics need to be able to support the needs of both; alongside providing he means to change the resolution of information provided to different peers based on the profile of the users.   \n\nOne of the principle methodologies sought through this approach is that the entity relations be represented by an image; such as is the case with Open Badges: [http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html](http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) although, using WebID-OIDC ( OAUTH2 ) for syndicating access between sites in a format that engenders a highly scalable, personally defined semantic web.\n\nSyndication between persons / entities that do not have autonomous sharing frameworks is more simply based upon FOAF based profiles, whether they represent people or groups. \n\nPrinciple 3:  Group Projects can be provided an ontological accounting framework, using DLTs. \n\nThat the solution needs to support the means to store private keys and related RDF statements that support the means to engage in group works and have effort ontologically counted on a decentralised ledger relating to activities produced in relation to that project.  These DLT keys enable the end-user to produce and participate in semantically operated knowledge equity frameworks, relating to the development of projects.\n\nThe intention of this framework is to provide a means to value the time and effort of others in a cooperative and/or collaborative informatics environment.  It is sought that we produce this framework in a manner that can support verified ‘solid based’ providers internationally.  \n\nPrinciple 4:  The phone can be a server.\n\nWhilst additional functionality is being sought to be produced in Wordpress, the phone itself is intended to be a server capable of operating off a local wifi network to deliver an engagement experience built on HTML5. A basic example of how this works can be found [https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/app-on-your-lunch-break](https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/app-on-your-lunch-break) although noting, solid does not currently support credentials.\n\nThe environment should provide support for a solid based app profile to be installed and run locally on the phone.\n\nPrinciple 5: The phone can be a 2nd factor authentication device.\n\nAs the phone is a personal mobile device, people should be able to use it to authenticate other devices.  it should also be able to be used to permissively engage in activities \n\n##### DATA MANAGEMENT\n\nThe solution should have support for electing what data should be cached on the phone, what data should be obtained over a mobile network and what data should be obtained over wifi connection.\n\n### Online - Wordpress\n\n\nRESOURCES:\n\n-   [https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/wpldp/](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/wpldp/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-rdf/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-rdf/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-tools/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-tools/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-linked-data/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-linked-data/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-relationships/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-relationships/) \n    \n\nThe primary purpose of the Wordpress based tooling is to rapidly deliver a scalable framework that supports cross-site communications of public, private and access controlled content feeds delivered across systems in RDF marked-up formats.  \n\nWhether it be posts, people, events, topic focused groups; or otherwise, the tables storing this data in Wordpress can be mapped to ontologies that can in-turn support finegrain access control structures to produce ‘semantic web’ experiences across a multitude of Wordpress sites for almost any use-case.  There are already an array of plugins to support different types of content, from blog posts, pages, comments and messages to events, projects, e-learning, social networking and much more; all is quick cheap & easy to deploy.  The use of wordpress as an example is not designed to solve all the problems; rather, it's designed to ‘get going’, through the use of Wordpress tools that are designed to be interoperable with the mobile app environment.  \n\nAs many of the basic social-app services are being handled by phone app, this wordpress solution focus on group engagement activities; and the means for multiple groups, to cooperatively syndicate topic and permissively work together on semantically augmented, group topics.  The Wordpress site is also designed to be interconnected with content analytics tools that can in-turn convert unstructured content into structured content.  (ie: entity analysis within a blog post). \n\n#### AUTHENTICATION\n\nThe first requirement is to have an AUTHENTICATION standard.  The consideration on how this can best be done is by making use of the [WebID-OIDC spec](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec#deriving-webid-uri-from-id-token) which extends parts of OAUTH2/OpenID Connect to support a linked-data URI, where further permissive informatics can be presented as to support the API like syndication of data between sites.  WebID-OIDC is at this stage largely defined for the authentication of individual users to authenticate against an application / site, and enable the access & storage of their personal data on their own ‘Solid POD’, including the means to obtain permission structures from the users-pod to obtain and generate a graph presentation through the application, by resourcing the data the user has access to, as is defined in relation to the users WebID-OIDC authenticated permissions; across the users social environment.\n\n##### SITES AS AUTHORITIES: The use of ‘open-badges’ / credentials\n\nThe second constituent relates to the means to easily produce a claim framework that can be used to support the issuance of authoritative permissions from groups.  The methodology thereby also seeks to make the methodology highly accessible, by providing the means to display an image that represents this relationship to affected agents and the means to easily; and providing this structure in a form that is interoperable with the WebID-OIDC spec, as to produce semantic graph frameworks that are able to represent the particulars of an individual participant alongside the semantically distinct social roles and attributions relating to them and by extension, the environments that they’re involved with as participants.\n\nThe current belief is that making use of the [Open Badge v2 spec](http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) is the best way to achieve this outcome.  The intended benefit becoming, the means for a user to create a selection of syndication rules and requirements which in-turn generates the authentication tools needed to provide permissive data-sharing between sites; and that, this is in-turn packaged together in an open-badge / SVG image, that is both portable and easily uploaded into the target Wordpress site to enable decentralised communications across participating sites in a defined, semantic manner.\n\nThrough the use of Linked-Data for interconnecting Wordpress sites, the intention to produce an ecosystem result that may also support discovery (via search) of content across a decentralised network of sites, based upon structured data related queries.  Structured data support also leads to the means to form permissive data-sharing structures based upon structured data statements.  \n\nFor instance;  If it were applied to the Wordpress based news-sites, a parliamentarian or government department might form a privately accessible category within their own Wordpress site that is made able to present all articles that have some particular keywords in them; such as the parliamentarians name or content that refers to the government department.\n\n#### WP-RDF FIELD MAPPER\n\nThere are a lot of different plugins and systems built for wordpress and they’ve all got different ways in which they use the database. The exchange protocol between websites would use RDF with authenticated relationships to maintain a data-stream (api) that is secured between sites.   The fastest way to make Wordpress content syndication work with existing plugins; is to provide a means that makes it relatively easy to map the existing fields stored in the Wordpress database to RDF fields; and to offer the means for plugin providers (and their communities) to make and distribute schema that enables the use of their products in these sorts of implementation methods.  \n\nThis ‘field mapper’ plugin should also support the means for the author of a plugin to provide a script that automates the process for the end user.\n\n#### SOCIOECONOMICS - KNOWLEDGE EQUITY SYSTEMS\n\nThe social equity system is being principally designed in the first instance to support collaborative projects online, with a view to extending support to incorporate the use of RDF signed DLTs that aid in the management of many different types of projects.\n\nThis framework requires the means to associate different types of points with different types of actions.  The ecosystem requires acceptance related business systems; that ensure participatory submissions are supported by group based ontological syntax that ensures the systems work and are not subjected to unnecessary (or unworkable) forms of abuse.  To start the process of figuring out how this works, Web Civic is intending to build-out a ‘knowledge economics’ system that provides a means for people to accumulate and distribute credits in relation to their activities and the way they want to support (or have a say about) the works produced by others.\n\nThe challenge is, that this is not simply a linear framework.  People should be able to articulate qualities relating to reputation, such as [kudos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudos) and a means to show both how they’ve supported the projects of others and how well those projects have gone overtime.   \n\nThere are qualities about how people contribute and consume the work of others, and how it is that others value the work provided by others through their efforts in doing web civics.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bC4pFjnEtZ4VLnrJlu-9UUZA4MP-gq8a3HJz5WpvB8UDTV9jdCVi0Kc43zvGaxYpL2O01iGzXUs1-2r16tMohXb5rIJaEJ03UCzDdxnhOaYhkA5NSrD70uvvIghnFOpPGV1WV5tCSEaBV7mAncawVYVWYBf_wY2JhEzp-0aLQkP8Y9uc3FNf3-yhqv-u)\n\nWhere it comes to project development (including software, documentation, graphics, etc.); In one of my earlier draft publication of years of work, one of the still draft articles [discusses the concept](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/executive-summary/knowledge-economics-services/) of a contribution chain.  Now, some years ago, I built a very simple example to demonstrate the concept whilst working on the w3c web payment standards (required, as a constituent ‘tool’ to now do this work).\n\nThis methodology in-turn can be related to many different forms of knowledge equity, from frameworks that create a measurement systems that promote and/or demote content provided by others based on whether the contents of those articles are true and correct or false and misleading; through to whether others valued a particular post or link and moreover (perhaps most importantly) the ability for users to collaborate on a project of some form and to define an ontological structure around how work is accepted by the group and/or group administrators and how, in-turn, the group can cooperatively develop something that can be made available online through a web civics framework; that has the effect, of stimulating the development of creative works online through the means of making use of online systems to support the means for ad-hoc communities to contribute resources towards the creation, of something.\n\nEach of these systems are designed to employ ontologies for the management of ledger artifacts that are build upon ledgers relating to any type of project.  The purpose herein, is web civics - and so, the systems are to be first tested and developed as they are made to be useful for the purposes of stimulating web civics activities.\n\nimportantly also, the systems need to have a methodology through which the various types of ‘knowledge economic products’ (similar to financial services industry ‘products’) are able to be converted from the notations on cryptographically supported ledgers and related frameworks; to an exchange point, that is able to calculate the micropayments that may have occurred across a multitude of ledgers as to accumulative process and deliver to the ‘web civics’ user, a payment or a bill.  \n\nWeb Civics, helps to manage how all these systems works and charges a transactional fees for supporting the means through which these more advanced functions are facilitated.   Systems used more simply for civics, may not require the use of these knowledge economics systems at all; but for those who are interested in contributing towards the development and availability of technology to collaboratively define and solve web civics problems. \n\nThese works on knowledge economics through the use of innovative social-equity frameworks, as knowledge workers - may make the difference between worrying about whether they’ll be living on the street or how they’re paid and therefore able to sustain their own means to do good work, alongside any additional means brought about, to help others in need.\n\n###### Diversity and Knowledge Economics theory\n\nKnowledge economics can be far more diverse in nature than traditional economic metrics and to illustrate this point, here are a few examples.\n\n  \n\nSlicing pie is an example that helps illustrate the various types of roles, jobs and responsibilities that can be linked, ontologically, through the development of machine readable tools - like machine readable, minimum wage / award rates resources for different sectors. Another interesting field of ‘knowledge economics’ relates directly to kindness, which can be employed for purposes such as improving the diversity of persons involved in scientific events and projects. \n\nFinally, the means to employ machine readable document to support the needs of persons via digital payslips and digital point of sale receipts, which provides the means to describe products (and/or services) and both enable the use of that information for other purposes (ie: health) but also, as a means to support donations of specific forms of help, to those in need by the community.\n\n###### Economic considerations with respect to financial structures\n\nThe company structure seeks to consider the use of a dynamic equity model improving the flexibility of the use of shares for corporate governance and investment activities.  It is sought that Invested Funds be provided a fixed rate return, whereby when this has been achieved the equity (shareholdings) can be reclaimed by the company.  \n\nWith respect to the software development projects a consideration is that for commercial use, prior to return on investment + a fixed percentage as an administration charge; that the developed components be sold to 3rd parties seeking to use the source code to create their own products.  Once the invested funds obtain ROI, then the source code involved is made to be made freely available.  The Rationale is that whilst the projects are open-source civics projects; the work involved in making it still needs to be funded. \n\nThe eventual goal is for web-civics to end-up with a membership base that is able to participate in the governance decisions of web-civics.  To achieve this, the ecosystem tooling needs to first be established, matured and developed sufficiently as to ensure a crowd-sourced equity finance activity is capable of delivering the desired result. \n\nCrowd-sourced funding (CSF) (also called equity crowd funding or crowd-sourced funding of shares) enables eligible companies can raise up to $5 million a year using crowd-sourced funding but they must have less than $25 million in assets and annual revenue, and investments are capped at $10,000 per company in a 12-month period per investee, which makes it perfect for web civics...\n\n##### \nFurther information\n\nBuilding the realm for artificial intelligence powered systems to best be made capable of changing the nature of how it is your world works for you as you, in-turn, depend upon the way it has been designed to enable you to do anything for anyone, including you.\n\n  \n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b14M58YeQa-Axc23AtDnXOUShmjRGvFd_Zmo_u9Xh-Rd6OHc9YRwBcdghsvK1ch9iejD-FfYUzZmv9FQDoyc3ubDf5vE6nZWf4oDPFPPBhxjRWAATgFr7OQJ0kw4xHgeoZsiykTY6CYn0FLf3Y8uhA5uqG-khjJ_nagsRJda9g5ObLVE-gUn3QjcBBzn)\n\n  \n\n## Disclaimer & forward looking statements\n\nThis document contains an array of forward looking statements and considerations based upon works undertaken on a best efforts basis to establish a projected framework through which it is considered feasible to establish Web Civics in a particular way to undertake particular early works and to deliver particular outcomes.  The statements have been made in good faith, whilst working as quickly as i can on establishing the framework requirements to bring this all about.  There are many things that might change which may in-turn dramatically change the economic frameworks in which the intended outcomes set out by this document may be achieved and there are many more risks relating to the underlying assumptions and requirements that are best able to be achieved via the traditional approach, of setting up the organisation and going down a pathway that seeks to clarify the broader opportunity and requirements analysis as may only be made possible by any such team who do in-turn engage as to commence works cooperatively and what may be brought about as a consequence of their specified group works, together in the way defined by them, together.**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Existing Ecosystems/Semantic Web/Ontologies/FOAF/","title":"FOAF"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\n\nFOAF (Friend of a Friend) is a project that aims to create a decentralized social network on the web.

All too often, the study has just not been done.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fo-k9Y4HuGAHhIXQWEQ7Zw.png)\n\nGoogle Search “[define Identity](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+identity)”\n\nThe common use of the term ‘identity’ means different things to different people, which in-turn also relates to the role they are facilitating in life whilst using the term. Companies, Governments often use the term in relation to the definition of ‘sameness’, that a group have a passport from a nation, drivers license or login credential for a website of someform.\n\nYet others, when speaking of identity, do not mean this; rather, their use of the term seeks to denote their personhood, agency, character or more broadly, who they are as is distinct to all others.\n\nIn this paper i am introducing a somewhat broader approach that is intended to bring about an innovate solution to define ‘human identity’, for a ‘human centric web’ which attends to both forms of the definition, as may be applied to the intended purpose(s) to be employed, on the web. As to describe what this means — i use the term ‘inforg’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OwH0YqNN6R49yOVvrYvbag.png)\n\nGoogle Search — [define Inforg](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+inforg)\n\nThe term ‘identity’ can be used to mean ‘the distinguishing character or personality of an individual’; or for other purposes the term can refer to ‘sameness’, as to consider that ‘the Australian identity’ harbours Australians who were born or became ‘Australian’. Yet the inferred, or perhaps built-upon contextualisation of ‘digital identity’, brings about far more sophisticated considerations than have ever before been part of our societal considerations. As such, the concept of ‘inforg’ relates both to all digital records created and collated in association to a persons ‘identity’, but is therefore also extended by the choices made about how to make use of that data on networks, via AI.\n\nContextual records relating to the activities of man; as are historically studied as part of a global conscious ecology, now illustrate many forms of diverse fields of study; from ancient cultures and archaeology, through to modern day neurosciences, behavioural informatics alongside the countless array of unmentioned pursuits.\n\n> Some may say, the need to know ‘who we are’ is built into our biological fabric, as a conscious human being.\n\nThe Advent of Artificial Intelligence as active, artificial agents brings about new tools that act to supplement the capacities of humans, with new tools. This is in-turn expected to influence everything about us, and our world.\n\nArtificial Intelligence will influence the means through which we learn how to better understand ourselves, how we may be safe and best grow — to meaningfully participate in our world, with dignity.\n\n> From the development of belief systems through to our means to engineer languages and through such means, form common-ground, in support of the development of our lives, our families; societies, and the creations that mankind share, at a foundational level — these are constituents of our shared interests. Whilst AI can communicate our virtues, AI itself, doesn’t have them.\n\nMost of the time, work, is about making a more positive impact than the cost incurred for ones mere existence and the service of ones basic needs. This is an intrinsic and fundamental part of what it means to be human; indeed also, through an array of illustrative qualities that are often shared, with other living things.\n\nYet as a consequence of ‘internet’, we now traverse this complex concept in a manner that has never before sought to be done before.\n\n> Our goal as a species, should _at a minimum, be, to understand how_ these tools will lead to controls by way of _ever present_ custodial apparatus, that is now being engineered.\n\nIrrespective of any personal views by any human being, ‘_digital identity_’ infrastructure is mandatorily required; and at a minimum, will be employed for the purpose of externally defining who we are as persons for others who need a characterisation. People today, generally — don’t ask “_What constituent considerations, are going to be considered_’ as the vast majority of people don’t have a reasonable grasp of AI and the way it interacts with activities, human experiences and law. They don’t know what has been set-aside…\n\n> In all too many cases, organisations employ sophisticated legal understandings, make every effort to mitigate risk, particularly in response to wrongdoings..\n\nThe Agents of legal personalities, are electing component of our lived experience; to be considered by them to be the made most important means to characterise a person by way of information systems. The operators of these systems are in-turn empowered to provide **_authority,_** of how we be defined whether this is based on full-facts or a fictional representation of the truth, illustrated using _some_ facts which in some cases, can act as to be quite dishonest. Privacy can be employed by them, to protect themselves from repercussions and responsibility for harm caused to others for their wrongdoing. This is not what the spirit of privacy, nor identity was thought to be defined to achieve, yet those moral objectives have been undone.\n\n> These decisions, impact what we are able to do as a consequence of curated and ‘selective histories’ of our fuller, lived experience often misrepresented by poor skills (or wrongful acts) employed as to define the account.\n\nThese trends impact and influence our society and behaviours, as we become mindful of its role in our lives whilst some exploit it & others fall victim to it..\n\n> “It is not my fault”, the system gave me the wrong information, the person who made life altering and severely damaging decisions about another person says.\n\n> The machine itself, considered to be a tool that harbours no responsibilities….\n\nThe sources of information AI is being built upon today, repurposes old records, much of which may contain false information — for use with new sophisticated AI ‘predicative analytics’ systems, to build definitions of persons. This objective being sought based on the information entered into these systems that associate well to a story, that is all together, too often, false.\n\nThese records, may be inaccurate or poorly characterised considerations; stored in secret or in confidence; the status quo, is most probably considered the _most convenient_ pathway; for those offered the role of this ratified undertaking, to classify mankind; with the promise of a better role, once the job is done.\n\n_Whilst notes are made and lost in the practice method of creating it, what is considered to be ‘out of scope’,_\n\n> ‘but i couldn’t advocate for those functions to be added to it, i wanted to keep my job’ says the paid employee, who knows the wrongs built into the system, ‘best efforts’ they say, without considering how it might affect ‘data subjects’ and how time may find that it disaffects someone they love or care about…\n\nIt is not that clarifying trustworthy information to improve support for citizens, for natural persons does not exist, it’s just not added for AI.\n\nToday, we are engineering these ‘_identity_’ systems that actually say far more about the nature of the institutions creating them, than the human subjects they tell us they serve. The choices they have elected, to do so, implicitly corresponds to the structural nature of a small institutionally supported group; and legal needs of a market sphere operated by legal agents, who by short-term calculations, often seek to make more money, the more they consume.\n\n> Like ‘[_Bitcoiners_](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)’, The designs of how it is we build the tools to support the needs of humanity; and implicitly therein, role of all members of our human family, of mankind, as individual agents must be far better addressed.\n\nI have not seen any public enquiry, seeking input from across the many fields of society asking how ‘digital identity’ services relate to those societal fields.\n\nYet, when all such people get home and spend time, consciously, thinking; forming opinions and solutions to their problems both via forms self-curated means and as curated by nominated groups, its often the case they know that people so very much deserve better.\n\n> When will they realise, that their seemingly _small_ role, in something far bigger — has created something they don’t want, when there is a choice that is available, to spend the time and effort required to build a meaningfully better alternative.\n\nWhen solutions fails to meaningfully provision the same or similar, levels of usefully available informatics; as is required to render the delivery of a meaningful positive societal decision, that’s when it’ll be too late.\n\n_The hope is that the means to engender sane, conscious awareness that,_\n\n**_What is of most importance is our means to retain human agency._**\n\nYet it is still arguably considered, the merits of suggesting that **it is essential** we now consider whether its worth being bothered worrying about it; or whether it’s reasonably deemed easier, to simply consider these big issue _“out of scope”_.\n\n_Traditional solutions for enterprise systems & coupled digital identity, won’t work_\n\nOld designs, that have emerged and proliferated since the late 1990’s, are now a threat to our very existence; but few have taken the time to consider how, why and what the instrumental considerations to these historically poor decisions means.\n\n> Through a lens that is now able to benefit from hindsight, those involved in creating the infrastructure environment now in-place; have been integrally involved in dedicating their time, to defining a safe pathway out.\n\nWhether it be Tim Berners-Lee, Vinton Cerf, Craig Newmark or the relatively small handful of others — there is a palpably high level, of mutual concern.\n\n#### **Introducing the ‘human centric’ approach**\n\nThis document illustrates an alternative methodology that is entitled a ‘human centric’ or ‘human centric web’, approach.\n\nI will canvas various aspects across the spectrum of social, technical and personal fields of research, with a view to forming a vastly simplified document; that is aimed towards providing an educational foundation for the exploration of an alternative series of socio-economic informatics systems & engineering principles.\n\nI strongly believe the approach i have fostered with few others, will assist in laying the foundations to a better future, than those most likely to occur otherwise today without intervention.\n\nThis field of science and technology is amongst the most complex series of concepts to communicate.\n\n_It is not simply resourced from one domain of subject matter expertise, but many._\n\nThe traditional problem being, that the stakeholder frameworks incorporate all of humanity, both personally and professionally; and the means to coherently communicate solutions understood by all, is very, very hard.\n\n_I am hopeful this document will provide a coherent summary, delivering an outline that_ posits important arguments for _further societal considerations and/or, as may be considered historically, be vindicated, by its means, for this creative and intellectual contribution — to stands the test of time…_\n\n**My Journey — Background of my research & related works**\n\nThe Author, Timothy Holborn, has worked on how to form meaningful solutions in this problem domain, since first considering an [ibank](https://web.archive.org/web/20190312002734/https://sailingdigital.com/iBank.html) for the future advent of online data storage and ‘apps’, back in 2000.\n\nPrior to the commencement of these more structured works, I had developed a keen interest in psychology / behavioural sciences, philosophy, ICT and was somewhat initially inspired by the works of [Sir John Carew Eccles](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.2), who is an extended family relation.\n\nFrom 2000, i started to conceptualise the ability to form an online software environment whereby users were the beneficial owners of their data/information.\n\n_When this was first conceptualised to be much like networking an operating system like Microsoft Windows and extending the functionality to both support ‘online data storage’ and provide the means to network information stored by a person, about themselves; with others, was a part of the starting point._\n\n_The difficulties embodied by this idea grew to be incrementally identifiable overtime._\n\nBeyond the technical and commercial licensing challenges exhibited at the time; alongside my immaturity as a young professional, the broader and perhaps most difficult series of issues identified early on; was the complex nature of the impacts any such proposal would bring about.\n\nSince that time, Web 2.0 evolved and with it, vast global silos of information about our world. Throughout this time (2002–10); I more simply ‘chipped away’ to garnish an understanding of the vast variety of fields that needed to be taken into consideration.\n\nWhilst one such work led to a [press notation](https://www.theage.com.au/national/start-me-up-20040619-gdy1tc.html) of good work helping young people, the challenges brought about by foresight, was hard.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4RJVW3ueJn0EeBgtYkiLjg.jpeg)\n\nI knew, for some inexplicable reason; that if a structured ‘fit for purpose’ process, strategy and capability was to be properly defined at all, the insights needed to be inclusive; and this early insight, continues to portray troubling exhibits of over-simplification, through to the present day.\n\nMy path led to an involvement in numerous ventures across a multitude of fields, alongside actively seeking to both hone and develop my skills to undertake sophisticated evaluation processes in relation to socio-economic environments and business systems; and to resource the opportunity to evaluate practice fields beyond my area of expertise and skillset.\n\n_Amongst the more troubling areas of our communities that were evaluated from a ‘problem solving’ perspective, in a variety of ways; has been a means to study and review the effectiveness of governance systems, in relation to basic social needs._\n\nWith particular consideration about the means to employ a lawful response to acts that may cause injury to persons; and, the nature of complex strategies employed by those who knowingly seek to exploit a variety of endemic governance vulnerabilities, for ‘ill gotten gains’.\n\nIn 2010, It became inescapable to discern any choice about _whether or not_ our systems **needed** to be better employed, to deliver outcomes that meaningfully support the spirit of law, our democracy, our means to grow, heal and improve our means to protect the most important of our human & shared values, consequentially.\n\n_Back then, the w3c standards activities needed work done._\n\nSo, from ~2010–1, i got on with the job, and whilst it appeared that the universe was on my side as such things as the opportunity to support a program to educate kids about our system of democracy, i took solace in the words defined and communicated by others whose works i admire, and set-out on a journey to make what may be considered a ‘vision statement’, real.\n\nIn more recent times, these studies have incorporated ‘[_entity analysis_](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99)’ as to garnish a comprehensive understanding of the mechanical frameworks employed by international ICT apparatus supply chains, alongside related studies into socio-economic systems; and some of the emergent challenges that are now being brought about in a manner that is highly influenced, by the nature through which systems operate today.\n\nWith this comprehensively canvased understanding, executing a pathway that harboured the burden of seeking to maintain support for a role that sought to defend and protect the needs of natural persons in advanced technical specifications and related works; worldwide, a field of interest considered incapable of investment — a pathway was forged, and the rest is history.\n\n> _Now, some years on — the scope of works, has become a globally recognised opportunity._\n\nIt is now broadly understood, that there are real-world opportunities to both do good; and help foster meaningful solutions for a sustainable socio-economic future. Through good architecture, these works have both forged; and, have been instrumentally involved, in the production of component tooling, with luminary others worldwide.\n\nThe consequential strategy, that was so purposefully employed, has tactically sought to dilute any proprietary intellectual property rights that may result in royalty fees being made payable to any entity; for the preservation of human personhood, agency and related fundamental tenants for the protection of human consciousness.\n\nThis strategy now has historical linkages to vast investments, world-wide; that have cooperatively defined the necessary pieces. There is no one-company who can do it all themselves, and those who are now implicitly involved to perform the role of international leadership are worlds best.\n\n> This impossible mission, has brought into a _framework_ for consideration, the needs of interwoven and interoperable systems frameworks to form means through which our natural world is to be supplied a man-made ‘digital twin’.\n\nEmbodied consideration, for the meaningful use of this _proposed_ socio-economic apparatus; could be best employed by social governance frameworks through cooperative works, in good faith, between a plurality of _‘permissive commons’_ curators, and related participant structures.\n\nEconomically, the mechanics are designed to be sustained through the articulation of economic fees as may be attributed to be a cost that is applied to payments for work activities.\n\nWhilst some other models seek to engender the means for persons to ‘sell their data’, my view is that this is an enormous hazard and that the commercial employment (and growth) of this strategy should best be avoided. With that in mind, the opportunity to make meaningful employment of social informatics advances the known sciences as a series of embodiments, that i suggest be considered along the lines of ‘permissive commons’, becomes tangibly made real by becoming ‘built into the web’, as to best power STEM.\n\n**The “ Human Centric Web” Concept Overview**\n\nThe philosophical principles that distinguish this ‘human centric’ approach to all known others; incorporates the following set of principles,\n\n1.  That the cyber realm is one of many environmental embodiments of artificial tooling that has been made exclusively, for the benefit of mankind and through us; our means to positively impact our biosphere and advance our capacity as a species. The cyber realm is one of many forms of artificial apparatus, which are now interwoven into complex global systems.\n2.  Physics, quantum physics and related fields of knowledge used to engineer meaningfully useful things; incorporates a set of practical rules; or put another way, the means to communicate and make use of natural laws. **_Promoted solutions_** that act in a manner that forms scientifically contrary qualities, between the claims and science, is at best, inefficient; and moreover, capable of being far worse. Of most importance, is the means for natural persons to be reasonably made better equipped; to support their capacity to undertake ‘sense making’ activities; including but not limited to, learning.\n3.  The legal foundry through which; any thing is able to be brought about, is functionally a framework of instrumental importance. Whilst there are many issues that can be identified, within the text of law, and indeed also the practice of it; by professional law makers, law-breakers, and those who are masked as one whilst acting as the other; the advancement of societies worldwide is inextricably linked to the evolution of systems of law, lore and similar principle variants such as religion.\n4.  Infrastructure tooling that incorporates considerations for intellectual property rights; via business systems that ensures that there is a shared undertaking; to ensure that at a minimum, the technological tools and apparatus required to protect, preserve and serve the needs of the members of our human family as to bring effect to their basic rights to preserve custodianship over their conscious being; incorporating considerations of agency, personhood and the provision of tooling required to support any rights; must be made available upon the same commercial terms as all most important languages of the past. Should ‘identity’ not be made available unless a commercial license fee or payment is first made; then the same rules should apply to the use of any and all other local languages. The purpose and foundational importance of vocabulary is inextricably linked to any further means that may be made abl to be meaningfully employed; as to ensure the communicable capacity to form reasonably levels of trust, and their capacity to review materials as to support basic _social_ sense-making responsibilities.\n5.  All (other) Artificial things are made and held under the custodianship (a) of human actor/s. Whilst the desecration to delegate agency to legal persons and their agents; is an instrumental part of how things are made to work, the underlying responsible party or parties; are those human actors who have some practical relationship to those artificial things, no-matter how complex or simple, that be made able to be articulated.\n6.  That it is most important to consider the maintenance of our biosphere and all natural life on it. It is believed that in-order to do so, an array of publicly available and machine-readable ‘charter’ terms need to be made available for the purpose of ensuring humankind have the means to evaluate services based on said form of merits.\n\nPerhaps the most important of technical points: Maintaining the use of URIs.\n\nIn-order to form the means through which AI agents that form interference relationships with members of our human family, and through those means; by extension, the rest of our entire known world. Informatics storage must be made in formats that are both portable between service providers as authored by the moral owner; and made to be useful as a machine readable resource.\n\nOnly these means are able to encourage the growth of AI standards, as to support the goals otherwise outlined by this article / document.\n\n**What is the ‘human centric web’ concept of an ‘_inforg_’.**\n\n_The Naming concept of an inforg is defined as an informational representation of an organic being._\n\nIn this environment, i use the term to define a knowledge [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics) environment that is designed to equip its owner with their informatics environment.\n\n> This informatics environment is designed to make use of AI services as a trusted prosthetic to a persons life.\n\nThe name or concept is also similar to the idea of a ‘digital twin’, which refers to a digital replica of a living (or non-living) physical entity.\n\nWhilst a possible distinction between the two concepts is that a digital twin is considered to be a ‘digital replica’ and an inforg is considered to be a collection of information, without necessarily represented as a ‘digital replica’; the underlying concept that is brought about is that this type of functional tool; requires a series of technologies to be integrated, or incorporated in a functionally defined way as to support the functional requirements, of this sort of platform tooling.\n\nAs apposed to traditional tooling, the intended purpose of an inforg is to provide an interconnected online space and related tools; as to support the means for data or information, to be both stored and provided trusted computational and networking services on behalf of the natural agent (human being) that this ‘inforg’ operates to represent.\n\nThe (technically plausible) conceptual framework, would require means to depend upon a group of trustworthy social and technical foundations.\n\n**_In terms of the more important social foundations;_**\n\nThose would include, the means for this computational environment to undertake its intended purpose with the means to be able to legally depend upon the characteristics required by the inforgs owner; such as to include, privacy, security and other legally accessible rights that provide certainty and support for the inforg owner to reasonably and deeply trust this computational service; in a similar way to how most would trust that the money in their bank-account, is unlikely to be stolen as to leave them without their funds, for no fault of their own.\n\nIt is envisaged that the necessary means to accomplish these social goals is for the services to be operated in relation to the same jurisdictional territory that the inforgs human host is bound to as a citizen, in the real world.\n\nUpon the basis of this underlying consideration being supported by the operational environment of the inforg; it is expected that governments will need to define and legislate a series of particular laws as to ensure the services are ‘fit for purpose’.\n\n**_The technical foundations_** have been engineered to principally make use of [semantic web technologies](https://medium.com/webcivics/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) and related informatics ecosystems.\n\nSemantic Web technologies provide the means for URIs to be employed for describing information in a format that can be made use of by machines to perform the cyber equivalent of ‘sense making’. To do so, the computationally important design elements are centred around the qualities of semantic web technology that makes the information ‘machine readable’.\n\nThe practice of so doing; brings about two different forms of the web.\n\n1.  Web of Data: all the brains, without a _coupled_ user-interface\n2.  Web Platform: web pages, for traditional ‘web browser’ Interactions\n\nThe qualities embodied in the ‘web of data’ functionality are critical for providing the capacity for the ‘inforg’ environment to work.\n\nThe Web of Data is a technically defined framework, which is empowered through the creation of vocabularies.\n\nThese Vocabularies are call ‘ontologies’; and from a machine point of view, that is, a ‘cyber agents’ or AI, the web becomes interconnected world-wide in a way that distributes to ‘cyber agents’, all known knowledge about any particular permissively obtained description of a thing, and its permissively discovered relationships, to all other ‘things’.\n\n> This practice method; in-turn, requires as many people as possible to contribute towards ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’.\n\n**_OPEN DATA vs. PERMISSIVE COMMONS_**\n\nI am using the term ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ as a means to both describe ‘open data’, whilst also seeking to ensure the practical ‘social requirements’ relating to the contribution of useful resources is known to associate to electronically certified others; across our globally interconnected world-wide-web.\n\n> In society, we have different roles and in-concert, working together, mankind has achieved many wonderful things.\n\nThe Web of Data benefits from this constituent of social-reality best, when every person is made able to contribute towards the available knowledge of humanity, on this hyper-media empowered global communications environment; both in life, and in relation to our roles at work, and in other forms of group work.\n\nThe **Web of Data**; would be made best able to thrive and improve the lives of all; if the means through which we interact with it every day, sought employment of a social contract that forged a means for each little micro-task, making connections between different things; contributed towards commons knowledge facet, that could be made use of; by others across on the web.\n\nImportantly therein; these ‘connections’, between otherwise disconnected ‘things’, is required for our _Cyber Agents_ to form the computational means to better serve our needs; and, it is most desirable, that we do so in a way that means we do not unnecessarily waste energy, by requiring our computing systems to privately learn what is otherwise ‘common knowledge’.\n\n> In simple terms, it’s like agreeing to provide “DNS (like) services”, for AI.\n\nThese types of computational functions are not new. Presently, the vast majority of ‘web use’ is predominately restricted to a few major sites produced by fewer global companies. Over many years, those global companies have been building tools that collect as much information as they can get, from us; and then producing other tools to help us train the ‘cyber agents’ that they have developed, improve upon; and consider to be their private and commercial asset as a key component of their business critical infrastructure that helps them to profit from the use of their services by humanity, as to serve the financial (and governance) interests of their customers, and shareholders.\n\nThe difference brought-about by coupling the ‘inforg’ framework with computational services; that are purposefully designed to produce, promote and improve upon a global framework for ‘permissive commons’; is that, these raw resources, as are required to make any ‘cyber agent’ (ai) function, would no-longer be the property of the very few; but rather, is formed as a humanitarian investment that is cooperatively developed for shared benefit; as such this should, minimally, provide an alternative to commercial offerings that can be improved upon cooperatively, as to ensure the tools of mankind are made to serve, and not to rule.\n\n> It’s like an AI empowering version of ‘open source’, for knowledge graphs\n\n**_So, in the interests of reviewing these important points._**\n\n1.  The environment where a human beings ‘digital twin’ is being grown, is called an inforg.\n2.  The inforg is really important to a human being, and needs to be protected by law.\n3.  The inforg incorporates technologies that are designed to support the creation of an artificial intelligence helper\n4.  The way that technological creation is made able to work, or perhaps in simpler terms — the tools needed for the ‘artificial intelligence network based operating system’ — is created by employing programming languages, that are complimentary to ‘semantic web’ based functional requirements. This ecosystems framework provides the means to build into the web as a ‘human centric service’, available knowledge of the world from the across the web, in standards based machine readable formats, so that the artificial intelligence system can understand what it all means, across the web; and this is mostly made possible, by through the use of ontologies.\n\n**Informatics & storage**\n\nToday; the data, information and/or content that is being created as a consequence of the existence of a human being whose life relates to the use of the web whether by themselves or others, but in most cases both. In todays present world, there is an enormous amount of data or information, that is being generated about us, in relation to us; and as a consequence of our wilful acts or (_probabilistic_) intents.\n\nAll of this data is stored on systems, all around the world, operating within different legal frameworks — many of which do not consider your legal or moreover moral rights, whether or not you are a citizen of the country that is identified to be the operator of that ‘data service’. Making matters worse, the way these systems work often leads to information produced and stored for one (or some) purposes, being shared elsewhere.\n\n_In other circumstances_, the information produced and recorded in relation to a human being, may never be provided to the human being. In all too many cases these systems store information put into a system by someone else, that can incorporate statements that are misleading, simply wrong, perhaps about someone else entirely, entered by mistake.\n\n_As there are no ‘built-in’ accountability systems:_ Sometimes, it can be the case that a person may intentionally enter data into a system, without thinking about the implications; that may cause long-term negative impacts on a human beings life… If for some reason this sort of thing is identified, it may be very difficult to resolve the matter with meaningful lawful remedy.\n\nIn many circumstances; human beings, as natural persons (rather than in association to a role as employee or similar); are not provided information in a useful digital format. The volume of informational resource being collected also includes many straight forward examples, like retail purchase receipts, payslips and other information assets that are stored by the seller (or provider) of a transaction; but not provided to the human (customer).\n\n> In modern societies world-wide, it’s fair to say that ‘our lives are saturated in data’, but it’s not being provided to us, for our use.\n\nPart of the more practical issue that must be fixed, if any solution is to be found; is that human beings, need a safe place to store that data….\n\n**The Inforg is designed to be that place** for human beings to store furnished copies of all the records that relate to them, providing an opportunity for governments to be encouraged, legislative acts, make law, more important.\n\nWhether it be the information about your whereabouts, or the logs about who you interact with, what you buy, what the doctor or police officer has to say about you; the benefits of ensuring the collection of all of this data is something that human being can be made able to do.\n\nThe [Web We Want](https://webwewant.org/) needs our elected representatives to prioritise the changes we all, as human beings, need; and it is the case, that this will provide an enormous opportunity to ensure we are all made ‘most capable’ to make the world a better place, in all too many ways… cooperatively, one job at a time.\n\nBut this inforg environment, is not simply about the information produced by others. It is also about a place to store the information produced and stored somewhere today anyway; about the interactions the person has with their computer powered things.\n\nA photo, to an inforg — isn’t just a photo;\n\nThe photo, may have\n\n1.  particular people in it,\n2.  particular identifiable objects (whether they be flora, fauna, place-names — and related sensor data)\n\nAll of the pieces of information, now more simply considered to be ‘a photo’; incorporates an array of information that is now able to be both human, and machine readable. This, is a BIG part of what the cyber agent, linked to a permissive commons framework-is about, and is covered in more detail in some of my other posts, such as this one about [hypermedia](https://medium.com/webcivics/media-analytics-59a7cb27dc76).\n\n> Similar functional capabilities are today operated by a few big companies.\n\nThis alternative business systems model that _could_ be employed, as an alternative, would be operated in a manner that makes your AI empowered knowledge; known, owned and operated by you.\n\nWhy? Because it’s your digital twin.\n\nYour _inforg_ is essential for your means to be the beneficial owner; rather than more simply being considered to be — the consumer, of all the information that can be found, stored and sold — about your life..\n\n> Every document you write, the history of the web-pages you visit, it’s not going away…\n\n_Increasingly, by law, all of this information must be stored somewhere for a period of many years._\n\nSo why aren’t you asking why it isn’t the case that all of that data be stored by you, rather than being stored by all of those other companies all around the world?\n\nWhy is the idea of labelling humanity to be more merely _consumers,_ considered to be so reasonable; that in so many ways you cannot even easily make use of data relating to the facts of your existence; as they make use of it by engaging with other businesses to share _profits_, employ _consumers_ who work in a business that tells us,\n\n> Its here to help OUR World.\n\nSo to summarise this point;\n\n1.  The inforg is the place where all of the information produced by you and in relation to you;\n2.  is stored in a particular type of format, so that you can use it;\n3.  you’re able to make use of apps that understand these standards to use it; and,\n\n**_That you’re able to make use of it with your ‘cyber agent’ that is a functional part of how you define your digital twin._**\n\nBut not everything you say should be _blindly_ trusted without some real-world, social context.\n\n> What we call the necessary ‘fact proving’ tamper-evident, cryptographically supported practice; is, a verifiable claim.\n\nSome basic examples of a verifiable claim (otherwise known as a ‘credential’) includes; a birth certificate, drivers license, government issued IDs, academic qualifications, working with children checks, professional certifications, insurance certifications, event invites, bank-cards; and the means to control IoT things.\n\nBasically, a credential, or verifiable claim, is a document, that for the purposes of an inforg — is made to be ‘machine readable’ and cryptographically validated as to support the means for an inforg to make use of these tools provided by issuing authorities, to support the means for the inforg to communicate statements made by relevant authorities, in relation to the fulfilment of some sort of sensitive request.\n\nExamples include; purchasing alcohol, or filling a prescription; voting in an election, or going to a music festival, with your digital ‘credential’ ticket.\n\nIn summary; the _inforg_ environment is provided important ‘reality checking’ support tools, that provides it the means to support the capacity for its physical twin, to present important information when required and be supported by the cryptographic proofs that a variety of related ‘claims’ are shown by the interconnected systems, to be trusted as true.\n\n> Not everyone needs to know everything, and we all have the right to ‘change our perspective’, which is an important outcome — instrumental for learning…\n\n**_Self Engineered Informatics via and your Dynamic Intelligent Agent_**\n\nThe most important functional characteristic of this ‘inforg’ environment, providing the means for the ‘digital twin’, to be defined by the physical twin.\n\nThe functional property brought about by all of the complexity; is the way through which the custodial decisions made about how data is stored, and and useful using semantic web technologies; leads to the means for this otherwise static informatics environment to be made use of, by an artificial agent.\n\n> The design choices that are so very different to traditional ‘digital identity’ strategies and works, delivers a means to ensure the _physical twin_, is able to be the agent who defines how the _digital twin_ is programmed, to represent them via cyberspace for matters of importance in the real world.\n\n_Agency is only reasonably made part of the design decisions of ICT, if the person the environment is designed to represent, are able to make their own choices about their own lives._\n\nThe way this semi-engineered ‘_inforg environment’_ is designed to store information incorporates support for temporal informatics. This is in recognition that overtime, decisions are made and that this fluid process is an important constituent that must be reflected in the systems. As such, the otherwise inferred characteristics include;\n\n-   The ability to ‘go back in time’ and look at ones life.\n-   The means to ensure that agreements made; that may subsequently be updated, are known to be considered, in association to the time of the decisions made.\n\nThe means through which this environment is programmed makes use of semantic web tools, in particular, to produce temporally unique programmed functional settings; that are able to interact with all other ‘agents’ dynamically.\n\n**_What does ‘Agent’ Mean, in this context?_**\n\n_The term ‘agent’ is used to define something that the cyber agent is able to communicate with, or categorise to have some form of ‘identity’, such as: a person, group, software or physical artefact._\n\nThe intended purpose of this inforg is to create, what is called, an ‘[informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics) environment’ that is able to make use of the available knowledge a human being has about (and in relation to) their lives, overtime (past, present and means to help inform for the future).\n\n_Through these means an inforg provides the ability to use applications developed by people (and groups) around the world, using world-wide-web standards; in a way that provides the capacity to uniquely define ones self, in the cyber environment._\n\n> _There are no known means through which anyone else is able to reasonably and properly profess their capacity to define another._\n\n> _AI does not act like humans, it never will._\n\n_This underlying, dynamic agency relationship between the cyber realm and the real-world; is amongst the many ‘core issues’ that needs to be fixed for the benefit of all real-world stakeholders. the choices about life, should append to the agent who harbours the most responsibility for it._\n\n**Why is this ‘inforg model’ superiors to the way the internet works today?**\n\nAmongst the many, many benefits; the greatest benefit, likely to be of most importance for humanity, is the ability to make use of the broad electronic library created and stored about a persons life (and socio-environmental / socioeconomic interactions.\n\nThe unique qualities of this inform method, is envisaged to empower humanity with vastly improved means, to employ ICT capacities to apply the use of knowledge, with a privately operated artificial intelligence agent.\n\n> _Blending the capacities of human consciousness via ontological design, with an AI agent, to carve pathways through the world overtime._\n\nTo figure out solutions to complex problems, that would otherwise be impossible to consider, review and resolve or solve. To make use of our tools, to solve problems in the world.\n\nPart of the socio-economic design is to resource the availability of these ‘inforgs’ via a marketplace; whereby it is my belief, the means through which this is done is in the form of what i call a ‘[knowledge banking industry](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99)’.\n\nIn the USA there has been talk about ‘[information fiduciaries](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)’, and in the UK talk of ‘[data trusts](https://theodi.org/article/what-is-a-data-trust/)’. The embodied distinctions have been considered in relation to the [DIKW Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid). In a [draft Wikipedia entry i have created about a future ‘knowledge age’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Knowledge_age); the object components that are able to be distinguished by this ‘inforg’ orientated, ‘information management system’ supports knowledge engineering in a fundamentally different way.\n\nTherein the philosophical considerations are that,\n\n-   Wisdom, is in a persons head;\n-   Knowledge, is not simply the information that one might export from leading platforms today; but expressly incorporates (or packages) the ‘metadata’ and AI related informatics that helps to distinguish the characteristics of information, as to form ‘knowledge objects’. (which is in-turn supported through the conceptual availability of ‘permissive commons’)\n-   Information is the resource employed as a resource for informatics enrichment; and,\n-   data — is the raw resource, that makes the mediums, work.\n\n**_Dignity enhancing_ design, privacy, ‘permissive commons’ Informatics**\n\nThere are emergent capacities and opportunities to radically enhance our capacity as a species to analyse enormously complex problems. These include medical &medico-legal problems, that can be better responded to by making use of the vast amounts of data about a persons life, activities and inter-relations that can be deeply personal, and if used improperly, able to equip a bad actor to cause severe injury and/or death. Part of how the beneficial use of our _knowledge technology_ can be safely brought about, is through the use of ‘permissive commons’. Where permissive commons systems are built into the web in a manner that supports decentralised and private use; knowledge artefacts that are instrumentally required to find solutions can be made available to help solve problems that would previously have been impossible to figure out.\n\nThis envisaged business systems embodiment of informatics networking can improve access to the knowledge that is needed by researchers studying in all so many fields; who need to understand the dynamics of how the problem that they’re trying to solve; impacts our societies today.\n\nBut perhaps — in consideration of the importance of understanding the importance of economics; there’s a means to figure out how to associate the work that people do, and the meaningful benefit provided to others consequentially. The cost of doing this, is that of accountability. Part of the point of ‘permissive commons’ is that the actions of people, is appended to the records and/or resources that have involved them in some way. If mistakes are made, if mistakes are regularly made; subject to permissions, this can be easily identified, studied, evaluated and responded to, as to quash nonsense.\n\n**Critical Cyber infrastructure to power the growth of _Knowledge Nations_.**\n\nA society that is built upon the use of Inforgs, powered by a knowledge banking ecology; is able to usefully bring about new types of economic tools, that are better defined for use; with the world-wide-web.\n\nThis view is predicated upon a subjective opinion that WWW infrastructure is not simply content informatics supplied over the HTTP protocol; but moreover, becomes a term used to encapsulate the development and growth of [the information management environment produced on top of the platform first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html).\n\nWhilst the provenance of contributor co-inventors of this platform remains unclear, there is a growing problem that may most easily be characterised as ‘web slavery’ and other forms of widespread biosphere (including but not exclusive to homo sapiens) exploitation that desperately needs to be addressed.\n\nAs to affect change, the information management topology needs to bring into the framework — inforgs. Without inforgs, the means to address the role of natural actors (human beings) as foundational participants in an economic landscape of knowledge equity and [knowledge-based capital](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) growth.\n\nAs a constituent to these economic constructs, inforgs, and ‘[knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99)’ infrastructure is designed to support sophisticated ‘graph enabled’, financial products (economic instruments) that provide means to incorporate traditional workers rights, for people who do valuable work in connection to the web.\n\nWhilst there are many new forms of ‘financial products’ that could be offered by ‘knowledge banks’, one example includes the means for this infrastructure to support the curated supply of a wage through thousands if not millions of tiny financial contributions being streamed across, in acknowledgement of a useful contributions that have been carried out by a person over a payment period (ie: week, fortnight or month).\n\n> An easy way to think about this has been considered by forming the term ‘frictionless employment’, where this inforg based online realm, provides a means for persons to identify a ‘job to do’, and to very easily — go about getting it done.\n\nIF our online frameworks sets out a ‘set of terms’, to develop and build upon a mutually agreed set of principles, a moral equity framework of ‘fair dealings’; then,\n\n-   The means to attribute human activity, in addition to natural resources, energy, advertising and similarly already embodied online economic value chains; and,\n-   The means to attribute the activity of a person to positive socioeconomic effects, can be brought about.\n\nThis means humans are defined by the core fabric of cyber infrastructure to be more than a consumable resource; but rather,\n\n**_As first class economic participants in the cyber realm._**\n\nInforgs solve the otherwise inexorable central problem, that a network of internationally curated, organisationally issued ‘identity’ (instruments) cannot otherwise solve.\n\n> Today, ‘human identity’, is considered to be a ‘content’ issue.\n\nThe primitive identifiers that make internet work, are now legally allocated to be controlled by legal personalities ([persona ficta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) / corporations); and as a consequence of this, natural persons are not considered to be the primary custodians of knowledge equity today.\n\nWithout (legally protected) ‘inforg’ environments, we have the tools to fix the underlying socio-legal and technically instrumental problems, that now stymie sense-making, as required for social-systems to better invest in solutions, rather than repairs.\n\n**_The tooling i proposed to employ — is not all new_**\n\n_The body of technical works that have been required, to make this opportunity_ **_viably_** _available, has a long history._\n\nMy proposed ‘inforg’ solution (incorporating thereafter the socio-economic apparatus required to make them work) is a creatively incorporated and curated methodology overall.\n\n> The underlying tooling is most easily characterised by the historical timeline of the creation and improvement of semantic web.\n\n_Whilst an unfortunate majority of technical specialists are for some reason still, of the opinion that ‘semantic web was an idea, that didn’t pan out’, it is in-fact the case that today — our web, is powered by semantic web technology._\n\nThe remarkable task that has been successfully undertaken via un-incorporated consortia such as W3C has now led to a circumstance where [the vast majority of technology companies, world-wide](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List) have cooperatively produced the underlying tooling AND provided [royalty free use of their Intellectual Property](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/facts#patpol) as to supply component ‘standards’.\n\n> Without those tools, we would not have an ability to make choices about the future of our world.\n\nThese (and other) tools, form a permissive-commons framework for a standardised syntax, that is able to be used to perform these many very complex functions, in concert; on a global basis, has taken about 20 years to build.\n\n> Yet some may ask — then why hasn’t this sort of thing happened yet?\n\nHaving been instrumentally involved in works relating to some of the pieces that have been needed, in-order to realise my broader long-term goal; in works such as the creation of standards for ‘[credentials](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/)’ or verifiable claims, what i experienced was a situation where there were very few [natural persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person) involved in the creation of standards, through the lens of what it was that THEY needed as individuals, particularly at the later stages.\n\nThe vast majority of these works are produced with a set of [interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference) related qualities, whereby the perceived purpose of standards work, is to obtain the royalty free use of the underlying patents (“intellectual property”).\n\nThose who are paid to do work on these standards, are members from Universities whose actions are often related to the needs of academia and academic sponsors (such as GOV); and moreover, Corporations, whose representatives have very specific interests that relate to revenue growth of their corporations.\n\nOften, the needs of individuals are considered ‘out of scope’ both, as a consequence of those design requirements or ‘use-cases’ not having been raised at all (no representatives in the participant pools); and/or, because any functional requirements would be considered to be contrary to the interests of key ‘intellectual property’ providers.\n\n> An effort by W3C to resolve this problem was undertaken in 2015, called ‘[webizen](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Webizen)’. Sadly, this effort largely failed.\n\n> [**Webizen**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Webizen)\n\n> Describes a ‘citizen of the Web’.\n\n> A Webizen is a person who is [**adept**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=adept) in [**Web**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Web) techniques and who essentially lives on [**the Web**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20Web).\n\n> Source: [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Webizen](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Webizen)\n\n_In my experience of having engaged in creative works, meaningfully contributing to the creation of particular attribute components; embedded into a suite of component standards (payments, credentials, rww, ontology works, media analytics, platform, crypto, etc.) My findings were that there was a complete lack of economic support frameworks for activities to be performed at this instrumental level through means of gainful employment. The reason for this was due to the structural repercussions of intellectual property & corporations law; which when considered in a historical context, was not then supported by the leadership related communications of problem/response activities, by world leaders._\n\n_Today, the situation has changed. Both our Technology and political leaders are amongst those vocally calling for change, and are now doing something about it._\n\nNonetheless, my studies have shown that the underlying concepts, of seeking to use our advancements in STEM for the betterment of mankind, is not new.\n\nOne of the most important considerations was set-out in an article by Vannaver Bush in his (post ww2) 1945 article ‘[as we may think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)’ which should be considered, in unison to the broader efforts made by leaders of the time..\n\nWhilst Vannaver Bush made considerations, back then…\n\n> “Consider a future device … in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.”\n\nThis was at a time where humanity started such works as to commence international diplomatic efforts [to form the United Nations](https://www.un.org/un70/en/content/history/index.html) and through this means, set out [a Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) (to) _recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,_\n\nstating clearly is said declaration that; ‘Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.’\n\nSo many years prior to the advent of ‘[fifth dimension operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Dimension_Operations)’, in warfare;\n\nThe editor of this seminal article ‘[as we may think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)’ introduced the purposeful objective of STEM works in the field of information sciences; by the following,\n\n> _As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man’s physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson’s famous address of 1837 on “The American Scholar,” this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. — THE EDITOR_\n\nSome years on, in 1965 the [early works](https://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS835/Lec3/nelson.pdf) by [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) spoke of a systemic methodology that sought to expose the relationships between cerebral concepts and indeed also, the means through which Copyright, or [transcopyright](http://transcopyright.org/) [could be employed in an embodiment of considerations he called xanadu](http://transcopyright.org/hcoinRemarks-D28.html).\n\nWhilst it is hoped that an elegant derivative that may be formed as a derivative of these works; is the means to ensure a far more comprehensive view of ‘where [the web first started](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser/)’ and a semantically navigable graph to explore all those who were involved; Today,\n\n> Society is looking to its leaders hoping they’ll make brave decisions at this time of great importance to the world.\n\n> _These designs are ‘human centric’, which is distinct. Alternative considerations embodied as ‘human centered’ (design), ‘people centric’ (noting ‘sameness’ by law of legal person, and natural person) or any other ‘similar’ vocab — can be distinguished by these means, for some very important reasons._\n\n_The concept of a ‘human centric’ approach forms a call to action, to review the way our societal administrative systems work today; and for all of us to ask ourselves, how are we serving the needs of our biosphere, and humans who are involved._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*U2hpvSzMkR0CC2KAgCvGxQ.jpeg)\n\nSome Barriers: A picture of [Thames Barriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Barrier)\n\n> Some may argue that the implications of accountability is all ‘too inconvenient’.\n\nMy research, overtime, leads me to form, what i’d consider to be a well-founded position; that,\n\na. it doesn’t take long to do the study required to understand benefits; and,\n\nb. that they way things are being built to work today — is actually far worse.\n\nEnormous mistakes are made all the time, there are millions of dollars spent by governments world-wide to investigate how important societal systems, now still continually under enormous strain — are only getting worse.\n\nAs may be illustrated overtime, the likely reason for this is rigidly coupled to the information management practice of asymmetrically storing information about all things in our world, in databases that are operated in the interests of legal personalities.\n\nThat through this lens, the answer to systemic problems is often suggested to be that ‘there is a need for additional funding’, whilst the underlying circumstantial statistical resources required to analyse trends relating to poor performance of existing business systems, remains ‘out of scope’.\n\n> That human experience has been factored by ICT as to be _consumed_.\n\nEven though, the knowledge of harm and economic cost does now exist; these ‘silos’ of information, as is operated by legal personalities for legal personalities; as now separates by law important ‘knowledge artifacts’, that acts to discourage non-organisational use through means that are rationalised as important, as to preserve privacy — exhibits effects contrary to ‘common sense’.\n\nThese harms, poorly impacting the dignity of all persons; are now most commonly ‘treated’ after _public outcry, engendering a reaction_ to make a new plan. In-so-doing, those ‘siloed’ custodial informatics markets, largely centred upon the needs of existing knowledge capital participants; has built, incrementally, using the same underlying business systems that have been applied through the adaption of pre-cyber business models, that will continue to deliver, worsening results overtime if the role of natural persons is not built into the core frameworks for how it is, ICT systems are made to work.\n\n> If we build ‘human identity’ solutions by simply providing identifiers tied to 3rd party systems, who by an exclusive business systems model are the beneficiaries of the informatics systems relating to human activity, we can’t solve the fundamental problem, responsible for many, symptomatic effects\n\nWhy? one might ask.\n\nSo, here’s ‘_the thing_’….\n\nOver my 19 years of study, as to be able to produce & describe this framework, that i know can and will work; My learning pathway, which others cannot be expected to ‘get’ by simply reading my derivatives, leads me to know that **human consciousness** has a material relationship to both physics, and quantum physics.\n\n> *** AN ADDITION*** The idea that quantum physics has anything to do with anything, is a topic that i’m not able to consider better, whilst i have (in particular) sought expert advice in this area — which has been incredibly difficult and quite discouraging as an experiential process. As such, i wrote [this article that provides by some basic level of narrated means, the views of experts; that appear to be considered completely unfounded by the vast majority.](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/theoretical-relationship-between-social-informatics-systems-and-quantum-physics-reality-check-6ce3781d1a29) I am hopeful greater clarity will become available, from experts, consequentially.\n\nThe methodology i now put forward describes a practical method and set of tools; to bring the natural agent, into the equations.\n\nThis concept is somewhat referred to in the video below highlighting considerations made by Henry Strapp…\n\nAlthough more sophisticated considerations have been more broadly illustrated [here](https://medium.com/webcivics/theoretical-relationship-between-social-informatics-systems-and-quantum-physics-reality-check-6ce3781d1a29).\n\nThe methodology does not simply consider these causality related influences on an individual basis as to consider the concept of ‘self’ in a vacuous form without considerations of environments & society; but rather,\n\n_forms a practical means to support both the needs of the individual or the ‘human agent’, in alliance with others, rather than merely and more simply being considered constituent resources, to be consumed._\n\n> When quantum physics professors and luminary leaders describe the specific traits of their fields of endeavour; they speak of ‘interference’ arrays, where causality of an act, produces a ripple effect overtime.\n\nThey speak of their studies that show to them; that our perception of our world, must be taken into account when considering the function of it; and that a distinction cannot be rationally made between the information a person has about their reality, and their reality.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uoy402GQgCKhAoy5GmD2zQ.gif)\n\nInterference\n\nWhilst i’ve gone into my considerations about the implications of these theories with respect to social-informatics in my [earlier writings](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/), the easy way to understand this is that it is like dropping pebbles in water.\n\n> Overtime, the actions of entities cause interactions with other entities, and this is in-turn an interference pattern.\n\nWhere those interactions are based on falsehoods, lies or ‘bad information’, this has an affect of causing a dissociative outcome; when comparing the reality of a situation and the ‘sense making’ derivative produced by the recipient or consumer of bad information.\n\nIn-effect, the theoretical implication is that the impacts these ‘informatics’ characteristics have is not simply something that’s about ‘choice’, but rather brings about an array of considerations that have a foundation in quantum mechanical sciences, as is applied to informatics systems and human agents.\n\nThe impacts on this rudimentary basis, it is postulated, affects how we are able to consider external includes that then occur ‘in the minds eye’; and that, consciousness is not simply built upon a ‘mechanical universe’, but rather, functionally embodies quantum mechanical effects; that provides reason to the concepts of ‘freedom of thought’, and the physics that help describe such human traits as creativity.\n\n**Our systems today, _are not known to take,_ these nuances into account.**\n\nThereafter the implicit consideration is that this design framework for **_inforgs_**, provides a material way through which agency is brought about is via linguistics — which in semantic web terms means, ontology.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*x7FOXl_s6boQOwhEOZke5A.jpeg)\n\n> **_The inforg environment produces an informational representation of a human beings life, that is socio-technically defined to be principally curated by the human person; as is conceptually similar to a series of modals for the personal custodianship of ones own “_**[**_digital twin_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin)**_”._**\n\nAn informatics environment about a person or ‘thing’ creates an ontologically unique fingerprint, which is in-turn networked across multiple peers. This is defined whilst making use of authoritative structures that can now include the creation of ‘fit for purpose’ knowledge banking infrastructure, that can co-exist in a form that is interoperable and able to extend across the web.\n\n> The knowledge banking sector is required for a number of reasons, not least of which is that of security and moreover systems of trust.\n\nWhat this inforg based, [knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99) systems apparatus is able to do in a manner unlike any known other — is to form a means of social-encryption, which is through to be capable of ‘quantum (cryptography) resistance’.\n\nUnlike ‘blockchains’, this cryptographically enhanced security methodology works upon the basic premise of making use of networks of cryptographically enhanced constituent components, across a network, that taken into account ‘human experience’ as a component of its cryptographic security methodology.\n\n> This methodology is thought able able to be employed in many forms, for proper purpose; In a manner that is thought to bring effect, to an extremely secure capability ‘sense making’ capability.\n\nIn-consideration; there are a large number of very sensitive use-cases where tooling needs to be produced to conditionally support ‘authoritative’ changes; that may cater for the needs of international & national security use-cases, amongst many others, some of which are considered in this article that reflects upon [dignity and societal attempts to preserve security and privacy](https://medium.com/webcivics/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0).\n\nAmongst the underlying considerations; are those that consider, that as a consequence of this infrastructure design paradigm being employed, there are many problems exhibited today that are unlikely to be so prevalent in future.\n\n**_What if this ‘vision’ doesn’t end-up materialising…_**\n\n_Are there alternatives?_\n\nThe answer somewhat depends on the specificity of the question.\n\n> The technology ecosystem framework i have described above has very few technical differences to the infrastructure now operated by large corporations such as facebook, google, apple & Microsoft; noting that those such as Microsoft, IBM, Visa, MasterCard and many others have been instrumental to the creation of the underlying tools required to bring this sort of ‘human centric web’ about.\n\nIt is the case today, that those such as (but in particular) Facebook, Google, and Microsoft HAVE the capacity to produce these sorts of environments fairly easily today.\n\nOne of the main constituent components to how this can be made technically to work, is now being developed by a business co-founded by Tim Berners-Lee called Inrupt, which is now the primary communications silo for an otherwise open-standards based implementation methodology called [Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/).\n\nThe difference between the set of tools (primarily) produced by way of incubation in W3C that is now ‘branded’ ‘solid’, and existing infrastructure that makes facebook’s platform work — is nominal, from a technical standpoint.\n\nFor the most part, the [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api/) (and related tooling) performs most of the technical functions operationally required to organise and curate an ‘inforg’. Facebook, in a project called ‘libra’, has led an international initiative obtaining ‘[non-binding letters of intent](https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-companies-have-officially-joined-libra-association-says-visa-ceo)’ from [an array of global groups](https://libra.org/en-US/association/) in an effort to bring about _similar_ infrastructure outcomes.\n\nImmediately prior to this initiative being made public, My works sought to establish a global Infrastructure fund that was aiming to be set-up as a public/private partnership ([BOT or DBOT model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build%E2%80%93operate%E2%80%93transfer)) for the production of critical platform solutions.\n\nMy investigations led to gaining a better awareness of [historical factors that relate to the city of london](https://medium.com/webcivics/history-of-banking-knowledge-economy-and-moral-poverty-59a85f9a5721), and thereafter the hope was to establish an office for the purpose of financing this global infrastructure endeavors in ‘holborn’;\n\n_whilst i wasn’t sure which more specific postcodes was best suited._\n\nThe Operational intention was to then, distribute the first implementation capabilities across the world, in a manner that could be operated on a domestically interoperable basis via the [ISOC Chapters](https://www.internetsociety.org/chapters/); in a manner that could be curated via an ISOC ‘global topic chapter’ (noting they have an office in Geneva).\n\nThereafter, the operational activity was thought to be best brought together via a deployment framework that focused upon ‘civics’ applications and was restrained against the being employed for other broader activities.\n\n> The reason for this restraint, was to ensure the first implementation did not become the last. I am concerned that the first to deliver commercially may not do so in a manner that would make it viable to form market-based competitors.\n\nA strategy, that could bring about solutions within years — is sought to form a means to make use of this emergent & operational infrastructure.\n\n> As to render assistance for cross-functional, society-wide stakeholder ecosystems to evaluate the requirements brought about by this distinct informatics system, as required prior to forming a means though which the operational system was made ‘safe’ for the production of a market-based knowledge banking industry.\n\nWhilst former attempts haven’t work out…\n\nThe announcement of Libra was enormously helpful, as the implicit result is that i don’t need to talk about the benefits of this kind of ‘idea’ anymore, as the biggest companies in the world have now not-only announced plans to undertake similar works — but can do so on platforms used daily by billions of people, in months.\n\nConsequentially, this quickly led to [senate hearings](https://www.c-span.org/person/?davidmarcus02) which in-turn acted to supplement topically related [senate hearings, that amongst other things canvassed the need to bring about micropayment standards.](https://www.c-span.org/video/?462660-1/online-platforms-entrepreneurship)\n\nOn that basis, i’m supportive of Libra. I’ve [written some notes in their community forum](https://community.libra.org/t/micropayments-knowledge-economy-related-considerations/732), and have found more engagement in one of their [facebook group communities](https://www.facebook.com/groups/libraprotocol/) that has been established since the announcement than, has ever occurred when collaboratively working on things such as solid.\n\nYet: The problems, as i see it, is about a set of choices that need to be made about how the prosperity and international growth of relations, as have been fostered since the advent of the united nations.\n\nWhilst libra, and projects like it — might rapidly deliver real-world solutions far more quickly than can be achieved by any other means — we best need these works to be directed by our governments to be articulated in a manner that be bound to (moral) standards.\n\n> This cannot be achieved, if our law-makers don’t understand what the implications are, for the decisions they may make about deceptively complex (made simple) series of considerations that impacts our world.\n\nAmongst the many other things, is the means to be made ‘best equipped’ to support the an intellectually and policy environment to support creative works by any person, towards positive species level, cooperative growth.\n\n“To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” [Copyright Clause, US Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause)\n\nThis means we need to figure out how the sentiments enshrined by law for the benefit of sovereign citizens of one nation state, may be applied also to those considered to be by law, [legal aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28law%29).\n\nIt means our legislators need to think about the needs of its citizens, as a resource that is instrumental to its role as a sovereign representative and protector of their rights; in a sustainable manner, that draws into the considerations various broader aspects that relate to our means to both manage our biosphere & what it means to support the good tenants of it.\n\nIf we consider the current ‘epoc’ to be an ‘[information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age)’, what i believe we’re talking about here; is the evolution of mankind into a ‘[knowledge age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Knowledge_age)’, where the federated permissive commons powered international (and perhaps interplanetary) communications infrastructure; isn’t plagued by ‘fake news’, and empowers any member of our human family to find a job to do, and to go about getting it done.\n\n> We need to be clear about how prior works such as the UN [UDHR](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), related instruments &principles; and how those principles can be made to apply to the creation, management and use of our ‘digital twin’.\n\nWhat do we need to retain human agency, dignity, what is most important for us to preserve [freedom of thought](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/executive-summary/preserving-the-freedom-to-think/) and ensure we can continue to support systems of government such as a democracy, which depends upon courts and the ability to supply a court evidence in relation to a complaint and/or breach of law.\n\n> What if we decide that the meaning of success is not about obtaining a billion dollars, but rather; positively affecting the lives of a billion people — perhaps.\n\nPerhaps it is those words by [Jason Silva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Silva) that must now be made to better resonant, given the tools now exist to be provided new options.\n\nAnd perhaps, If we do, we just might find — we get what we need…\n\n**_Broader, Ethical Considerations_**\n\nThere are several inter-faith declarations and historical references that lends support for the linguistic notes afore mentions; summarised in other related ways as to manifestly deliver a sense-making capacity that is greater than as mere animals, naturally able to sense and act upon a form of ‘moral grammar’.\n\nAn Excerpt from: [Noam Chomsky: 2009–10–29 Human Rights in the 21st Century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2K8mo-A5g&t=4898s)\n\n> “The fact that there are pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility. The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself.”\n\n> Noam Chomsky, April 2018\n\nIn early April 2018 i sought input from Noam Chomsky, in an effort to seek support in communicating the issue in terms that relate to his field of work.\n\nMy considerations were that if the informatics environments were operating in a manner that resulted in ‘consumers’ receiving bad information, then this would logically have an impact on human agency and the means to support ‘sense making’.\n\nThis in-turn appeared to me, to have a series of real-world implications that were echo’d in works and words discussed in the context of quantum physics.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nHenry Stapp on Quantum Mechanics and Human Consciousness\n\n_That whilst the decision to radically change the nature of our telecommunications, banking and software industries sounds like an enormous undertaking; only eleven years ago, the first iPhone was announced._\n\nThe types of large-scale problems occurring world-wide as a consequence of these informatics design flaws — built into the systems at a basic framework level, is preventing us from solving much bigger issues; and the means to go about solving our capacity to build a form of library for humanity in 2020 onwards; _isn’t that hard by comparison_.\n\n> Rather, and in consideration — the means to solve the sorts of bigger problems without it, i’d consider to be impossible.\n\nWith the benefit of the length and breadth of my journey; it is, my opinion that the opportunities brought about already by some of the worlds leading firms.\n\nToday, as noted earlier, works called ‘[libra association](https://libra.org/en-US/association/#founding_members)’ provide an opportunity to ‘speed things up’. Yet, underlying issues squarely relates to the means through which we define world-wide, an elevated geopolitical heading.\n\nIn this future ‘[knowledge age](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67)’ it is expected that the answers we seek can be found locally via services governed by our law? _Or only via US law & ‘google’._\n\nToday, we have societal **_options_** to decide whom it is we entrust; to define and manage our ‘digital twin’, as may direct our lives; with (or without?) agency.\n\n**Emergent fields of nuanced design requirements.**\n\n**_Accepting the present as it is, as to get on with the job of fixing the problems…_**\n\n> anecdotally, in my life i’ve found that when bringing about significant social changes, the practice method of doing so, can be quite isolating.\n\n> A component of the lived experience reality is, that when someone sees a problem that they believe is such a thing that it must be attended to, as to change the situation for others in the future…\n\n> The problem for those persons who do the work, becomes, that as a consequence of influencing change; the problem doesn’t happen people who might have otherwise been faced with that problem.\n\n> Consequentially, there’s an isolating effect, that’s particularly hard where provenance systems fail to even substantiate whether or not someone had a positive influence in making positive changes to systems, as to benefit others.\n\n**_Inforgs & informatics; can have applied economics & employment virtues._**\n\nThis is somewhat similar to the broader issue of slavery over the ages, illustrated by the stories from the [book of exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Exodus) through to many more modern day examples. Perhaps the most destructive component that forms part of the embodiment for how our information systems are made to work today; is that, these designs encourages a new form of ‘web slavery’ which has two significantly distinct qualities.\n\na. Those who are in-effect, enslaved, are expected to find the financial means to survive elsewhere.\n\nThis is distinct to former forms of slavery, where the beneficiary of the slaves labour needed to maintain that slave labour resource.\n\nb. that the work-product of these ‘web slaves’ is now moreover suggested to either be; i. the exclusive work product of those employed by the recipient organisation; and/or, b. for the exclusive (whether in-effect, or otherwise) commercial benefit of the recipient entity and their partners.\n\nIn-effect, the problem of this new medium (www) being embodied as a platform that supports a frictionless approach to being able to ‘get work done’, without the means to support an economic articulation of ‘upon fair terms’.\n\nNow therefore; this means that inforgs become instrumental to solving the problem that today; there’s alot of people, doing alot of work, )particularly in fields considered to be ‘good for humanity’) whereby available socio-economic terms now results in many new forms of slavery. Amongst the most destructive, are those where neither income nor acknowledgment be reasonably furnished to those who have done the (useful) work.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jhuzL_hSjtH334mrzduJ8Q.png)\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=define+work](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+work)\n\nIn the 1800's & 1900’s an industrial era workers rights movement, characterised by such things as the ‘[8 hour work movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day)’ led to the proliferation of a middle class, through which the social foundations of internet was born. Sadly, on the new frontier ‘internet’, these rights and many others are now being stripped away.\n\nThe qualities of what is called more simply an ‘idea’, and the inaccessibly high cost of seeking lawful redress for exploitative behaviours is now so challenging, even governments are finding it difficult to form readdress. It has been made to be considered ‘acceptable terms’; upon basis such as;\n\n-   Your good ideas will not progress, unless those whose creative efforts brought about a later opportunity, consider giving their work away freely (at their own expense) to be entirely acceptable.\n-   That unless it is ‘gifted’ without any form of economic attribution, the consequences will necessarily be that the individual actor will cause harm to humanity in a way that all good people should fight them to prevent.\n\nWhilst these types of considerations do not appear to be equally applied to the activities of an employee of a corporation, to that of an independent natural person.\n\nWell funded & organised reinforcements to this proposition, often undertaken whilst being rationalised as ‘philanthropy’; also include means through which shaming of those who struggle with said terms being necessarily put upon them, that if they make complaints — be therefore excluded.\n\n> As though the consideration made by consideration to an entire ecosystems evaluation, is that to support a means that may pay a person even most simply, with acknowledgement & a minimum wage for their work; that to do so, would mean that a person is thereby working to monetise everything as to cause incurable injury to the entire world — when in fact, it just undermines their own personal ability to live with dignity, whilst making a choice to ‘do good things’, as apposed to the poorer choices made by others.\n\n> In reality, that’s moreover articulating a ‘human as natural resource’ ideology, that’s now better able to be understood to be the case, for how recipient markets members, operate, so ineffectively, today.\n\nSilicon Valley ‘brain rape’ scene\n\nThe basic problem to this strategically employed ‘business as usual’ approach, as is part of what most say is simply ‘capitalism’; is that the derivatives of a persons work is not a ‘full embodiment of knowledge’ produced by the originator of a creative work, usefully summarise in some form of derivative embodiment of work.\n\nMaking matters worse, is that we have consequentially not made & implemented the technology embodiments required to ensure that it is a choice to participate with others where these ‘group rules’ and ethics are employed.\n\nOn Christmas day 2016 I pulled together a set of considerations, relating to this body of work, that may help those interested consider the implications\n\n> IT’S NOT ABOUT BLAME: WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS OCCURRED\n\nOnly two decades ago, computing infrastructure consisted of mainframes, laptops and desktop computers only. Digital camera, palm-pilots and very basic mobile phones were emerging into the market; but since then, the world has radically changed.\n\nSo whilst it’s somewhat understandable, why, we find our world faced with these problems; noting therein, my ideas of an ‘iBank’ in 2000 through to my writings made today — have been shown historically, to have merit, whilst arguably a foolish series of considerations to pursue. Yet with that in mind,\n\n**The World Side Web**\n\ndave lorenzini from keyhole present’s at siggraph 2001\n\nThrough discussions & collaborative works with Dave Lorenzini (since 2017), known for works such as his earlier role with [Keyhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keyhole,_Inc&oldid=733479836), a term he communicated was this concept of the ‘web side world’ or the ‘world side web’.\n\n> Dave is now an expert in the field of ‘Augmented reality’, where our shared interests extend beyond the headwear, to consider the implications of the web in ‘augmenting’ our world; and through these means, the way in which we form a new cyber layer.\n\nToday, these emergent ICT patterns are accelerating major shifts, and are known to be introducing an array of complex new considerations.\n\nThe inclusion (or exclusion) of these considerations, significantly impacts our means to define outcomes that can be considered upon release — fit for purpose.\n\nThese fields include; but are not limited to,\n\n-   ‘Internet of things’ which incorporates; smart buildings, smart cities, smart environments, cars, robots, sensors and the interconnection of all such things.\n-   emergent ‘human interface devices’ that include; but are not limited to, biofeedback tools and devices (ie: wearables), photonics eyewear, brain-computer-interfaces, audio and video sensing equipment (which may learn to understand sentiment, mood alongside high-resolution activity monitoring);\n\nThese two, very simplified, fields of ‘computational device, diversification’ is going to lead to our world be digitally mapped and managed by a multitude of enterprise systems and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIt is in this field that the concept of a ‘digital twin’ is most-often used.\n\nPerhaps the most challenging of all considerations, is the likely impacts this will have upon the means through which gainful employment by mankind is going to be supported, in what is expected to be a very rapid transition.\n\nThe platforms established today to govern the widespread introduction of robots (both software & hardware); have very much defined a global framework for a company somewhere in the world, to deliver solutions world-wide.\n\nThe concern is that may well dramatically impacting societies in a timeframe never before seen; that is unable to be responded to adequately by governments worldwide; and that a viable solutions, is to build inforgs, and bound to support this infrastructure, the creation of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that could be defined to support regulatory terms, ‘fit for purpose’.\n\nIn so doing, it is believed that many of the greatest threats, are able to be tactically responded to and that this methodology provides the capacity for members of our human family to be materially (and legally) involved in defining how these solutions are made to work.\n\n> Any other alternative risks is thought to more simply defining ‘natural person’ entities as being declared, by business systems, as a resource.\n\n_As such, the ‘business as usual’ alternative, looks to grow an almost exclusively ‘artificial agents’ framework, continuing to be incrementally empowered to consider_ **_mankind, just another form of ‘natural world’ commodity_** _made available as to be consumed with the aid of a few, who care mostly, about wealth._\n\n_In-so-doing, even they may end-up trapped in the machinery._\n\n**_The Human Centric Alternative: Empowering our world via Inforgs,_**\n\nThe Inforgs concept can aid in establishing the underlying tools for a ‘_knowledge equity fabric_’ that is made able to better respond to the needs of citizens.\n\n> Put most simply, this is achieved by incorporating the legally defendable, technical means to ensure there is a capacity to bind decisions made by human beings/citizens, to legal relevance of any other decisions.\n\nThis means that we’re able to build tools that means we (humans) are more easily able to _meaningfully_ be engaged in ‘work activities’, even when their organised, in non-traditional ways.\n\nIt means we’re able to support the basic accounting needs to support new economic flows to uplift our circumstances from a time where it’s said that there’s a global scarcity of work; to a ‘knowledge age’ awareness, that there was more simply — far too few ways to pay people, for their work.\n\n_That we (could have) decided to build the means for our societies to engage in producing far more ‘frictionless employment’ tools, than is otherwise exhibited today._\n\nThat the means through which natural persons are socially considered useful, becomes better supported through the growth of information systems that provides natural persons the ability to quickly communicate an array of verifiable claims about their life choices and the history of what they have done.\n\nThat the problems of exploitation, confidentiality and wrongs of today, end-up becoming part of a programme scheme of corrections, to support state works that seek to form a ‘knowledge nation’, where STEM requires the means to better re:instate the value, of reality.\n\nWhere virtue, is more cost-effectively found by supporting research, long before any post mortem enquiry be found to be required by legislators and those who are most responsible to support the sovereign economic, safety and security needs, of a people that it is their sovereign responsibility to ensure all acts support fairly, their ability to grow.\n\nAt its most basic level, there is no good technical reason why infrastructure cannot be deployed to provide the means, for people to communicate ideas about ‘jobs’ or ‘projects’ that could be done; and be provided the means electronically, to easily engage with others to progress those ideas into outcomes that form employment opportunities; as are expected to be plentiful in nature.\n\n> Governments in-effect have a responsibility to fix these problems.\n\n**Economic Growth? how _does_ money work…**\n\nIt is important that people understand, how money works.\n\nMoney, tracks back in our western world via roman times, [Londinium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Londinium) and the advent of the templars, from the champaign region in France; it was the templars, who first formed a means to have a ‘ledger’ or sorts, so that knights to trade on their journeys.\n\n_From my perspective, as a_ [_Holborn_](https://www.google.com/maps/search/51.5172%C2%B0N+0.1182%C2%B0W)_, the story gets quite interesting thereon; but, that’s not the topic._\n\nThe point is that the way our money system works, is that there needs to be people doing this that are of value to others; and that through general ‘work activities’ there is the distribution of income, which is in-turn redistributed within the community by way of trade.\n\nThis system doesn’t work very well when people store all their money, nor does it work if the money is ‘gobbled up’ by the few or taken somewhere else so that it cannot be reused. By creating new _employment empowering or related_ infrastructure; there’s a means to redistribute wealth, and get things on the right track; & by producing tools that radically improve the means to create ‘frictionless employment’, cost of work goes down.\n\nWhat about ‘national security’, law enforcement & stuff like that…\n\nIn countries like Australia we have a system of democracy that is built upon [‘rule of law’ principles](https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/principles/) as was established and fostered several hundred years ago. These systems are particularly fragile in circumstances where the purposeful design of how these systems work, becomes poorly maintained.\n\nYet irrespective of these sorts of problems that do certainly deserve the means and opportunity to be addressed; the principles set-out by these systems of law outline a set of rights, responsibilities and benefits unto law.\n\n(most of the time) → It _should_ _be_ **your** system of government, who is best equipped to protect your safety and the [universality of your human rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) needs; far over and above the interests of any foreign country.\n\n**_But today;_** the data those who _swore an oath to protect the people, a promise they should be bound to; for_ their nation — are all too often, finding it too hard.\n\nOur governments are finding it too hard, and too expensive to get the evidence they need, in a timely manner.\n\n> Imagine a world where no matter how poor you are, you can walk into a court and seek immediate lawful intervention, with all the data at their fingertips.\n\nWhilst government, has in cases such as Australia, legislated the requirement for these foreign companies to pay government some tax income; this is not, in any stretch of the imagination, enough to protect the safety of Australians (for instance); where critical information could technically be provided, under lawful provisions, instantaneously — to solve a problem that may cause incurable harms, to those made victim of the technical and commercial choices of foreign companies, most interested in ‘other things’…\n\nThe capability enhancement, unto lawful provisions to protect sovereign jurisdictional territories and their systems of government; should, if well rendered — provide the means for any citizen, whether homeless or represented by another due to having been made unconscious; to seek lawful remedy for harms committed to them, by simply offering a judge the means to make use of their ‘digital twin’, to figure out what happened, and what is fair.\n\nMany might say this is intentionally not in place today; to which, i have lived experiences that lend my comprehension of some very unsatisfactory ‘bad actors’ that may at times, be considered to be part of difficult and systemic problems; that are all to hard to resolve, save sacrificing ones life, in tribute to malfeasant others — who are often enough shown, to simply be not worth it.\n\n_Whilst a video embed might say it’s supporting ‘do not track’, don’t be fooled._\n\nimho; The most rational thing to consider, is not whether you _serve someone_, but rather _who it is_ you choose to serve, and how you define, _on_ _just terms_.\n\n> The best outcome, i now therefore suggest, involves a future where your government acknowledges and protects the informatics environments depended upon by you; in the conjoint understanding, that any jeopardy brought about that may be of concern to you, is also a concern to them.\n\nThat the concepts of moral grammar and its means to be coupled to reality; illustrate fast facts, such as the means to be confident, that no-matter the role, job of achievements of any person — we are all, first and foremost — human. For this reason, amongst the many others — we need a human centric web. No matter how we decide to make technology investments, into promoted solutions — that should, at a minimum — fit, with our moral outlook in life. There is an express understanding that could be said through words such as ‘walking with footsteps, in the presence of god’ but moreover — this work has garnished me an express understanding, that you’re going to have to **serve _somebody… — and perhaps, my tireless efforts may help us all get away from the fake news and start to build far better infrastructure capabilities to invest, in reality._**\n\n**_Perhaps, those who benefit after we are gone will remember how difficult these next steps were for those who became thought leaders of our time, in defining the means for a sustainable world — that leads humanity to a new era, where our investments were instrumental to the way in which they were provided the means, to thrive._**\n\nTo learn more about the technologies that can bring this about, see my article about [tools that can help naturalise the web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3)."},{"fields":{"slug":"/placeholder/","title":"This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx"},"frontmatter":{"draft":true},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx\ndraft: true\ntags:\n  - gatsby-theme-primer-wiki-placeholder\n---\n"}]}}}
