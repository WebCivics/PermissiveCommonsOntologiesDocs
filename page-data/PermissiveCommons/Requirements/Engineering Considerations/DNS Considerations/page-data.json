If this were to be developed, new types of DNS records or a schema to define how these new types of DNS records would need to be defined. \n\n##### WebID-DNS\nThe WebID ecosystem is defined elsewhere.  Whilst there may be other considerations relating to the approach for making use of WebID or WebID like technologies; it may well be that the use of a domain name record to denote a particular entity is a potentially useful way to support a means to provide related semantics and in-turn also, support for authentication.\n\nYet, this would in-turn infer the use of particular types of cryptographic instruments to support the underlying requirements associated with any such approach; also, any content that may be encoded in a manner that defines the namespace, should also be temporally considered - ensuring the relationship between any such domain-name holder, and any authors / human agents; is able to be informatically supported (ie: correct inferences) overtime.  \n\nThe other factor relating to this type of methodology is that it would therefore be preferred that the domain name used, is not rented but rather owned by whatever legal entity relates to the informatics use of that domain name as a legal entity related identifier. \n\n\n","excerpt":"The Existing DNS system hasn't been significantly upgraded in a very long time.
