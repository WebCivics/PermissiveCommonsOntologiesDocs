Its got to be decentralised.  \n2. It must use Linked-Data (semantic web) related methods.\n3. There is no single protocol that can support all usecases; nor is any single decentralised protocol able to be considered reliably safe forever.  The protocol is about the carriage of information, not ownership of the information. \n4. Legal Entities are defined as responsible parties for content; not things / software. \n5. Any transaction should consider the cost incurred by the transaction; particularly in-terms of the amount of energy required to perform the transaction and/or populate availability.\n6. no transaction should be considered to have less value than the cost of biosphere and sociosphere related caculations associated to the ability to make an information transaction; yet the creator is able to define the terms that outline how non-energy related costs are sought to be caculated via the network.  (note; this requires ontologies, etc.)\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\n5.  There needs to be a way to cryptographically sign a document to make it tamper-evident; whilst including the information about the resource location of that document.\n6.  There needs to be a way to require multiple signatures for documents that have that requirement (ie: a vote in parliament).\n7.  There needs to be a way to run an agent, that is able to process requests from various protocols.\n8.  The unique identifier for a content asset that is the same as other copies of that artifact stored on other and/or across multiple protocols must be the same.  \n   *The client shouldn't really care which protocol it gets a specified record from, so long as the specified record has the same data. *\n9.  If a content artifact is different then it must have a different identifier.\n10. If a content record relates to a series, then it should have a reference to the previous version and/or an index that provides information about all records in that series.\n    \n    For example; legislation changes, so an updated document reflecting new changes should be made, and in-turn reference both or either the previous version or the index for the document series. \n    \n11. Every participating node should have a capacity to support currencies. \n     Whilst users may well define costs that results in a premium cost for obtaining information from that node - which would have the consequence of the network not making use of that node - unless they wanted to pay the premium. \n     \n12.  \n","excerpt":"This document provides a summary and index for the Permissive Commons Technology - and Permissive Commons Technology - Ontologies Ecosystem…","outboundReferences":[{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Permissive Commons is thought of as a form of technology, given the requirement for a specification to be defined in-order for it to be made to work harmonously online.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"/Existing%20Ecosystems/Semantic%20Web/\",\n    \"title\": \"Semantic Web\"\n  }, \"Semantic Web\"), \" Technologies are basically, part of the foundational technology components that are used for producing Artificial Intelligence systems.
