In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers), the design enables the controller of a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party. [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) are [URIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-uri) that associate a [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects) with a [DID document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.\n\nEach [DID document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) can express cryptographic material, [verification methods](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verification-method), or [services](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-service), which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a [DID controller](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-controllers) to prove control of the [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers). [Services](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-service) enable trusted interactions associated with the [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects). A [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) might provide the means to return the [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects) itself, if the [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects) is an information resource such as a data model.\n\nThis document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties, serialized representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent.\n\nSource: [W3C DID CORE Spec Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)\n\n\nNOTE:  These works are only loosely coupled to the psychological concept of [Disassociative Identity Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder) particularly with respect to the [[Webizen]] and [[Peace Infrastructure Project]] scope of works which actively seeks to address [[Social Attack Vectors]] related issues; including but not limited to Human Trafficking ( Note: [UNODC: Anti-Human Trafficking Manual for Criminal Justice Practitioners](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/2009/anti-human-trafficking-manual.html) ) and other forms of abuse that are closely tied to Severe Mental Illness as defined by the [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) publications; including but not limited to DID.","excerpt":"The concept of Decentralised IDentifiers was first raised on the  W3C WebPayments Mailing list in 2014 by Manu Sporny (whilst i'm noted - o…","outboundReferences":[{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The concept of Decentralised IDentifiers was first raised on the \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014May/0033.html\"\n  }, \"W3C WebPayments Mailing list in 2014 by Manu Sporny\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"(whilst i'm noted - often the context of these calls was that they were held in the early hours of the morning (ie: 3AM Sydney/AU Time)).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"whilst the works have developed significantly, there are some particular use-cases relating to a concept called \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html\"\n  }, \"Self Sovereign Identity\"), \" that has been the primary focus of these works.\"), mdx(\"h3\", {\n    \"id\": \"bit-of-history\"\n  }, \"Bit of History.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I was involved with the beginnings of this work, whereby i particularly supported Manu Spory as the Brains Trust for this and related works.
