Permissive Commons Technology (PCT) Requirements.

### Introduction

PCT is intended to provide a solution whereby commons resources (including ontologies) become part of the broader 'semantic web' ecosystem that would ordinarily be provided via HTTP via ICANN registered domains; are able to be provided via alternative [[Non-HTTP(s) Protocols]].

The solution seeks to address the following functionality criteria.  

Whilst not all solutions will support the same feature-set, different types of 'permissive commons' will have different requirements.

1. Permissions 
	a. Read
	b. Write
	c. Append
	d. Delete 

2. Version Control
	a. append only
	b. the ability to target a particular version
	c. the ability to delete previous versions
	d. the ability to redirect from previous version links

3. Users and User Groups
	a. The ability to support Agent-centric management
	b. The ability to support user-centric management
	c. The ability to support legal entities (groups)
	d. the ability to vary permissions within groups

4. Semantic Querying
	a. The ability to structure the resource index via ontologies.
	b. the ability to query the protocol based upon ontological terms
	
 5. Network Management
	 a. the ability to prioritise which versions should be stored
	 b. the ability to manage availability (ie: redundancy, retention, replication, etc)
	 c. the ability to provide structured information about the resources used 
	 d. the ability to work with currencies to support economic semantics
