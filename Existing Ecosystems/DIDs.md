The concept of Decentralised IDentifiers was first raised on the [W3C WebPayments Mailing list in 2014 by Manu Sporny](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014May/0033.html)

(whilst i'm noted - often the context of these calls was that they were held in the early hours of the morning (ie: 3AM Sydney/AU Time)).

whilst the works have developed significantly, there are some particular use-cases relating to a concept called [Self Sovereign Identity](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html) that has been the primary focus of these works.

### Bit of History.
I was involved with the beginnings of this work, whereby i particularly supported Manu Spory as the Brains Trust for this and related works.  The earlier history involved works on [Web Payments Standards](https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/) which led to [Credentials CG](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/) which was originally focused on Verifiable Claims and improving the [[Open Badges]] standards; which overtime led to DIDs.

Prior to the creation of Decentralised Identifiers, previous projects included WebDHT and HTTPA.  The hope was that DIDs were going to be the solution for providing permissive commons; however in more recent years, the works appear to have taken a turn towards being defined by many as 'Decentralised IDentity' which has some percieved problems, that i do not like or support; noting, that the underlying issues relating to these percieved problems are complex, and that i very much support the ability to have Verifiable Claims and Verifiable Credentials.

DIDs are also very closely related to various #Web3 and #Web5 works, that aren't actually about the use of the World Wide Web very much at all - whilst noting again, the complexities involved.  Perhaps most of all; an ecosystem using [[Verifiable Credentials]] and [[DIDs]] emerged and had a significant global role in the global promotion, that at times resulted in enforced requirements for people to be delegated 'Vaccine Passports' which appears to have been directly tied to newer members involved in the production of these technologies.  

This had the effect of breaching what i considered to have been a previously considered problem (at the time when works were seeking to advance [[Verifiable Credentials]] to become a chartered W3C Activity ) that i thought was agreed, would not be employed as a 'go to market' usecase.

### Wikipedia: What are DIDs?

**Decentralized identifiers** (DIDs) are a type of globally unique [identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier "Identifier") that enables an [entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity "Entity") to be identified in a manner that is [verifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials "Verifiable credentials"), persistent (as long as the DID controller desires), and does not require the use of a centralized [registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry "Domain name registry").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier#cite_note-W3_did-core-1) DIDs enable a new model of decentralized [digital identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity "Digital identity") that is often referred to as [self-sovereign identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity "Self-sovereign identity") or [decentralized identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identity "Decentralized identity").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier#cite_note-DID-EU-2) They are an important component of [decentralized web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_web "Decentralized web") applications.

### W3C: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0
#### Core architecture, data model, and representations

[Decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers). In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers), the design enables the controller of a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party. [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) are [URIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-uri) that associate a [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects) with a [DID document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.

Each [DID document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) can express cryptographic material, [verification methods](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verification-method), or [services](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-service), which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a [DID controller](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-controllers) to prove control of the [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers). [Services](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-service) enable trusted interactions associated with the [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects). A [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) might provide the means to return the [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects) itself, if the [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects) is an information resource such as a data model.

This document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties, serialized representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent.

NOTE:  These works are only loosely coupled to the psychological concept of [Disassociative Identity Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder) particularly with respect to the [[Webizen]] and [[Peace Infrastructure Project]] scope of works which actively seeks to address [[Social Attack Vectors]] related issues; including but not limited to Human Trafficking ( Note: [UNODC: Anti-Human Trafficking Manual for Criminal Justice Practitioners](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/2009/anti-human-trafficking-manual.html) ) and other forms of abuse that are closely tied to Severe Mental Illness as defined by the [DSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) publications; including but not limited to DID.
