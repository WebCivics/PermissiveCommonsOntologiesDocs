# Verifiable Claims & Credentials

Verifiable Claims work has developed and morphed into what they call 'verifiable credentials'.  

W3C [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) is a derivative from work that was started via the [W3C Credentials CG](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/).

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital documents that contain information about an individual or entity that can be used to verify their identity or attributes. They are often used to represent credentials such as diplomas, licenses, and certificates, but can also be used to represent other types of information, such as membership in a group or organization.

VCs use the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to represent and manage data in a structured and semantic way. They can also be signed using digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the information they contain.

Verifiable Credentials can be used in a variety of contexts, including authentication and authorization, identity verification, and data sharing. They are often used in conjunction with decentralized identity systems, such as the WebID protocol, to enable secure and decentralized authentication and authorization on the web.


The purpose of 'verifiable claims' is to create a cryptographically signed (tamper evident) container that can contain 'data' that can be relied upon as an instrument of 'fact' (regardless of whether or not the claims in it, are factual).  IE: The fact is, i have this 'verifiable claim' that was generated in relation to XYZ or XYZ circumstance, it clearly states 'these things' or provides 'xyz' information from "Alice" or 'bob' or 'acme .inc' which may be used as a instrument for electronic contracts.

### Verifiable Claims

Verifiable claims are digital statements that can be cryptographically proven to be true or false. They are used to enable secure and trustworthy exchanges of information on the internet, and are an important building block for a variety of applications, including digital identity systems, online reputation systems, and supply chain management.

Verifiable claims are typically created using digital signatures, public key infrastructure (PKI), and other cryptographic techniques. They are structured as assertions about a particular subject (e.g., a person, an organization, a product), and can include information such as the subject's identity, attributes, and relationships.

Verifiable claims are typically issued by a trusted authority, such as a government agency or a certification body. The issuer is responsible for verifying the information contained in the claim and for attesting to its accuracy. The issuer can also use digital signatures or other cryptographic techniques to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the claim.

Verifiable claims can be stored and shared using various technologies, including blockchain, distributed ledger, and secure data storage systems. They can be used to enable secure and efficient exchanges of information between different parties, and to support a wide range of applications, including identity verification, supply chain tracking, and online reputation management.

### Credentials

A credential is a formal certification or documentation that attests to an individual's qualifications, skills, or achievements. Credentials can be issued by a variety of organizations, including schools, professional associations, and employers, and can be in the form of degrees, certificates, licenses, or other documents.

Credentials are typically used to demonstrate an individual's competence or knowledge in a particular field or area of expertise. They are often required for certain types of employment, professional practice, or other activities that require a certain level of knowledge or skill.

There are many different types of credentials, including academic degrees (e.g., bachelor's, master's, PhD), professional certifications (e.g., Certified Public Accountant, Registered Nurse), and occupational licenses (e.g., pilot's license, attorney's license). Credentials may also be earned through other means, such as professional development courses, internships, or on-the-job training.

In addition to being used as evidence of an individual's qualifications, credentials can also serve as a way for organizations to verify an individual's identity and to ensure that they have the necessary skills and knowledge to perform certain tasks or functions.
