# Social Factors

This document is on my ToDo list - for more information now; see the related link in the [Webizen DevDocs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/)

The 'Social Factors' work seeks to consider factors that are not purely about software engineering.  These areas of consideration form deliberations that associate with various fields of endevour throughout the topics that might be considered part of the [Liberal Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education) ; and to be clear more broadly otherwise, those that relate to socio-economics, governance, human factors, etc.  

These constituencies are in-turn instrumentally considered and engineered to support the intended purpose of producing any software whatsoever.  

Software / technology - are in-turn intended to provide tooling that achieves goals of value and importance for human kind - both as individuals, and at large (ie: biosphere, sociosphere, etc.)
