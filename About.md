The About section provides some information about the background, the foundational concepts, the goals and requirements.  This section is intended to be less technical.

1. [[What is Web Science]]
2. [[Understanding Ontologies]]
3. [[What are 'The Commons']]
4. [[What is 'Open Data']]

The work on [[Permissive Commons]] is intended to start by figuring out the technical specifications required to [[Decentralised Ontologies]] and thereby enable [[Ontology Modelling]] to address [[Social Factors]] that need to be responded to in-order to solve problems that otherwise act to cause or support, harm experiences by people throughout our societies.

The [[old-work-archives]] provide some reference material sourced from older documents.
