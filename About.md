The About section provides some information about the background, the foundational concepts, the goals and requirements.  This section is intended to be less technical.

1. [[WhatIsWebScience]]
2. [[UnderstandingOntologies]]
3. [[WhatAreTheCommons]]
4. [[WhatIsOpenData]]

The work on [[PermissiveCommons]] is intended to start by figuring out the technical specifications required to [[DecentralisedOntologies]] and thereby enable [[PCTOntologyModelling]] to address [[SocialFactors]] that need to be responded to in-order to solve problems that otherwise act to cause or support, harm experiences by people throughout our societies.

The [[old-work-archives]] provide some reference material sourced from older documents.
