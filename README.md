# Permissive Commons Technology Docs

Permissive Commons Technology changes the way commons knowledge is managed on the internnet.  The intended purpose of it is act to decentralise commons resources and extends existing works on 'open-data' alongside other decentralised software projects whilst adding more functionality as a consequence of the abillity to use permission structures in relation to assets.  

If you'd like to get involved the main community channel is presently via the [Web Civics Discord Group](https://discord.gg/HX7W4gY45N)

There is also a [Peace Infrastructure Project Group on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14114713/)  and a [Human Centric AI Interest Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/humancentric.ai.tech), alongside various other channels (info to be provided later)

> *Indeed to some-extent, its hoped that the Webizen Systems will be up and running soon, which will have the effect of streamlining how to engage with topics - yet - to achieve this objective, the permissive commons technology work needs to be done to support it.*
> 
> *This project, is basically a type of work that is a form of [[What is Web Science]] related fields of expertise, as it requires a multidisciplinary approach to incorporate considerations and expertise from various minds / souls...*

There are many different 'usecases' relating to the use of 'permissive commons'.   Permissive Commons, and in-turn Permissive Commons Technology (PCT) Ontologies (PCT-ONT) is required for the [Webizen Project](https://devdocs.webizen.org/) which is the priority for this body of works.

INDEX

1. [[Permissive Commons]]: provides an overview of the broader goals of the project.
2. [[About]]: Is intended to provide historical information that is generally intended for non-technical people.
3. [[use-cases]]: is intended to provide the business systems related descriptions of various applications, related requirements, considerations and related works.
4. [[Requirements]]: is intended to be developed as a Requirements Specification, in-effect.
5. [[Existing Ecosystems]]: provides information about existing solutions and will in-turn support the ability to provide considerations about interopability and pre-existing functionality / methods.  
6. [[Work in Progress]]: provides information about whatever is currently 'work in progress' and/or any information about progress that has already been made.

### Ontology Modelling
The ontology modelling process is trying to address various requirements for [[Decentralised Ontologies]], [[Temporal Semantics]] and [[Permissive Commons]] which will in-turn support both the [[Safety Protocols]] as well as the [[Values Credentials]].

Much of the ontology work is in the [Web Civics - Ontologies 2023](https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023) github folder / project. Some use of [Chat AI](https://chat.openai.com/) has been employed, that has helped a great deal in some ways; whilst also problematic.  

This REPO is brand new and will be updated continually until it is RADICALLY improved. 

This documentation project / site is located on GitHub.  It is intended to support the ontology works located in the [webcivics/ontologies](https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023) folder progressing the [2023](https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023) branch, whilst also - planned to lead to a seperate permissive commons code library, in future.

NOTES
- [[Documentation Method]]: Provides general information about how this work is being produced an published online.
- [[Work in Progress]]: provides some information about what is currently sought to be done. 


### Licensing Notes

The **Copyright Clause** (also known as the **Intellectual Property Clause**, **Copyright and Patent Clause**, or the **Progress Clause**[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause#cite_note-1)) describes an [enumerated power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_powers "Enumerated powers") listed in the [United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution "United States Constitution") ([Article I, Section 8, Clause 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress "Article One of the United States Constitution")).

The clause, which is the basis of [intellectual property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property "Intellectual property") laws in the United States and specifically [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States "Copyright law of the United States") and [patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_law_of_the_United_States "Patent law of the United States") laws, states that:[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause#cite_note-crs-2)

> The [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") shall have power To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

3rd party works are provided via whatever license applies to those works.  

The works done by me are sought to be licensed via a methodology that's basically about supporting human rights.  This in-turn requires a means to support [[Licensing Frameworks]] (supported by the [[The Values Project]] and related [[Values Credentials]] ); to both [[Ending Digital Slavery]] whilst also (consequentially) empowering means to end-up providing licensing in a manner that has an array of express purposes, including but not limited to protecting [[Freedom of Thought]] without degrading the good purpose of any such forms of agreements.  

Until this is better define / resolved My Work is not licensed for any commercial purposes; and, all rights are reserved.  This is not intended to be contrary to the interests of [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]] or in-turn also [[Human Centric AI]] rather; that i note, i've been subjected to alot of very hostile (bad) actors, often they've suggested they've been 'doing it all already' - yet here we are, some 22+ years down the track and nope, the means to support the human rights of ordinary persons to make use of their information to support their rights, to support peace; its not been delivered by any such persons anywhere on earth.

Hopefully, an option for those who seek something like this, may be brought about; but it won't be made able to work properly (ie: #RealityCheckTech ) unless its done in a manner that addresses the sorts of issues described by the [[Safety Protocols]] notes, etc..

For more information on the work being done to achieve this, please note the [Webizen Dev Docs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/) and related project. 

As noted; if you'd like any further clarification let me know.
