# Permissive Commons Ontologies Docs

The Permissive Commons concept is like an advancement of 'open-data', whilst adding more functionality as a consequence of the abillity to use permission structures in relation to assets.  

This is basically a type of work that is a form of [[Web Science]] related fields of expertise.

Permissive Commons related documents;
- [[Permissive Commons Tech]]
- [[Open Data v3.0 Permissive Commons]]
- [[Tech for Permissive Commons]]

There are many different 'usecases' relating to the use of 'permissive commons'.   Permissive Commons, and in-turn Permissive Commons Technology (PCT) Ontologies (PCT-ONT) is required for the [Webizen Project](https://devdocs.webizen.org/) which is the priority for this body of works.

INDEX

1. [[Permissive Commons]]: provides an overview of the broader goals of the project.
2. [[About]]: Is intended to provide historical information that is generally intended for non-technical people.
3. [[use-cases]]: is intended to provide the business systems related descriptions of various applications, related requirements, considerations and related works.
4. [[Requirements]]: is intended to be developed as a Requirements Specification, in-effect.
5. [[Existing Ecosystems]]: provides information about existing solutions and will in-turn support the ability to provide considerations about interopability and pre-existing functionality / methods.  
6. [[Work in Progress]]: provides information about whatever is currently 'work in progress' and/or any information about progress that has already been made.

### Ontology Modelling
The ontology modelling process is trying to address various requirements for [[Decentralised Ontologies]], [[Temporal Semantics]] and [[Permissive Commons]] which will in-turn support both the [[Safety Protocols]] as well as the [[Values Credentials]].

Much of the ontology work is in the [Web Civics - Ontologies 2023](https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023) github folder / project. Some use of [Chat AI](https://chat.openai.com/) has been employed, that has helped a great deal in some ways; whilst also problematic.  

This REPO is brand new and will be updated continually until it is RADICALLY improved. 

This documentation project / site is located on GitHub.  It is intended to support the ontology works located in the [webcivics/ontologies](https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023) folder progressing the [2023](https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023) branch, whilst also - planned to lead to a seperate permissive commons code library, in future.

NOTES
- [[Documentation Method]]: Provides general information about how this work is being produced an published online.
- [[Work in Progress]]: provides some information about what is currently sought to be done.
