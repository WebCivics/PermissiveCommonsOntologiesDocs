This is where i'll put information about the work in progress.

### [Permissive Commons Technology  (PCT) (#this)](pct-devdocs.webcivics.org)

This documentation environment has been built using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and the [Obsidian Template for Gatsby](Obsibian Template for Gatsby).  The [[Documentation Method]] document explains how its done.

The process of producing the documentation; includes,

1. [[About]] Docs: General information about the Permissive Commons Project. 
	a. Information about Ontologies.
	b. Information about related historical works
	c. information for non-technical people to understand what its about.
	d. Information about the use-cases related to the use of Ontologies
	e. Considerations about the desirable stewardship models for PCT-Ontologies.

2. Illustrating some of the percieved problems with existing HTTP based ontologies.
	a. considerations about how permissive commons may usefully address those issues.
	
3. Technical Docs: Design of Permissive Commons; and,
	a. The intended benefits of decentralised commons resources
	b. its intended role with other broader ecosystems.
	c. information about the requirements for ontologies more specifically.
	
4. Creating an Architectural Strategy for implementing Permissive Commons Ontologies.
	a. Functionality Objectives
	b. Comparison of [[Non-HTTP(s) Protocols]] for the purpose of PCT Ontologies.
	c. Evaluation of candidate approaches in relation to [[use-cases]].
	
5. The Application of PCT-Ontologies via Webizen Ecosystems.
   
6. Learning resources to help people learn about related technologies.  
   
7. Working to update the content to address considerations about the many topics, etc.

NOTE:  This documentation environment does not easily provide RDF related functionality and the works on this site is not intended to provide name-space services. 


#### ISSUES

1. Whilst i'm aware of many Semantic Web Luminaries, it is most often the case that their skills in this area far outstrip my own.  Whilst i will work on a best efforts basis, i am entirely likely to make mistakes due to the software engineering related skillset not being core to what it is i do best.  
 
2. Existing Ontologies often refer to URIs that no-longer exist.  other ontologies are very old and now out dated.  A respectful approach to resolving these sorts of issues is desirable.

3. Whilst the ChatGPT Content provides a helpful start to writing content about a topic, it does need to be updated and reviewed; as such, the new pages where this has been used needs to be reviewed (when i get there)...  It has been found to provide garbage RDF relations when providing ontology related results; whilst also providing valuably useful support, for radically improving the productivity metrics for producing ontology works generally.
